Plex boasted dozens of individual apps, helping users to access streaming content, trailers and manage their media. In 2009, Plex was incorporated as a private company.</p><p>While the popularity of Plex continued to grow, a number of questionable decisions were made. These rankle with us. They might not bother you in the slightest.</p><p>The allure of self-hosting is that your media is running on your hardware. It's supposed to give you absolute independence, privacy, and anonymity: Download, install, stream - and it's nobody's business but yours.</p><p>Plex, on the other hand, is a mess of upselling and dubious privacy options.</p><p>For the purposes of this article, we (partially) ran through the installation process so you don't have to.</p><h2 id="h-a-plex-privacy-problem">A Plex privacy problem</h2><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//plex_website.png" alt="The front page of plex.tv showing cookie consent and Google signin popups" width="1914" height="949" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex_website-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex_website-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex_website-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex_website-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex_website-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex_website-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>Finding Plex was easy enough.

Selling a lifetime Plex pass gets them a one-off payment of around $100, and if you're committed to the Plex ecosystem, it makes sense to choose this option rather than monthly or yearly subscriptions.</p><p>But for it to be worth it for the company, their user base needs to grow.</p><p>People love to be part of a club, and to engage in the same or similar activities as their friends and acquaintances. They like recommendations, and things to talk about over the weekly Sunday get-together.</p><p>The Plex Discover service launched in March 2022 and allowed users to see what was new and trending across all of their subscribed services.</p><p>And in a November 2023 blog post, the company expanded the scope of Discover, stating:</p><blockquote><p>We can all agree that we love seeing a Fresh Tomato score, but nothing compares to those IRL conversations on Monday morning (remember those?) where we stand around (instead of working) and review—mano a mano—what we watched all weekend. Let’s call it the Water Cooler Effect...Sure, our curation is done by real humans, and our recommendations span the services you watch most, but add in the stuff your friends are watching and rating? That’s gold, Jerry! Gold!</p></blockquote><p>It's certainly gold for someone, but as reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/plex-users-fear-discover-together-week-in-review-feature-will-leak-porn-habits-to-their-friends-and-family/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">404 media</a>, users are discovering that Discover lets friends and family discover the smut you've been playing on Plex.</p><p>The company later clarified to 404 that:</p><blockquote><p>Plex does not generate community activity for known adult titles. The 'skinemax' type content you refer to in the article may not all be tagged as adult, so that is why these titles may surface in watch activity.</p></blockquote><p>Fair enough, but it's still embarrassing to talk to your uncle at the next family gathering when you know he's been asked to give a thumbs up to your viewing of<em> Bikini Chain Gang (Hard Love, Hard Time)</em>. And that water cooler chat in work could be agonisingly awkward when you know that your line manager spent the weekend binging such skinemax classics as <em>Secret Games ( Take a ride to the dark side of desire)</em>, <em>Secret Games 2 ( The darkest side of desire)</em>, and <em>Secret Games 3 (Revisit the dark side of desire)</em>.</p><h2 id="h-why-you-should-use-jellyfin-instead-of-plex">Why you should use Jellyfin instead of Plex?</h2><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//jellyfin.png" alt="A jellyfin instance with sections for movies, music, and shows " width="1902" height="906" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyfin-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyfin-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyfin-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyfin-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyfin-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyfin-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>We could spend all day enumerating the reasons why Plex is not our preferred server for self-hosted streaming hijinks.

There's no pass involved, and no upselling. Lifetime access? Screw that, it's built in. Just download and install the usual way.</p><p>If you run Linux, you don't even need to visit the site: open a terminal and if you're on a Debian-based system, enter:</p><pre><code>curl https://repo.jellyfin.org/install-debuntu.sh | sudo bash</code></pre><p>Boom. Done. You can create an admin account through the browser. The Jellyfin devs don't know you've created an account (it's on your server, not theirs) - nor do they particularly care. No-one gets your movie titles, or your metadata, or anything else. If you want to upload your logs for help with troubleshooting, you can, that's on you. No-one's forcing you.</p><p>Let's talk about extras for a minute - the kind of feature you'd pay for on Plex.</p><p>Watching and recording live TV? Yes, you can do that.

Create a Jellyfin profile for them, and set a maximum allowed parental rating, or restrict based on tags. You can even make an access schedule, where media can only play during specific periods, and will be stopped past it.</p><p>We ran through the entirety of what the Plex pass <em>allows</em> you to do on your server, and as far as we can tell, Jellyfin has most of it baked in. It's common-sense stuff, and the kind of useful feature that should be available as part of any basic package.</p><p>One area in which Jellyfin positively excels in comparison to Plex is with third party apps. You can use Plex through your browser or with an officially supported Plex app. With Jellyfin, anyone can make a comptible app and put it on the app / play store or on F-Droid.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//jellyclients.png" alt="Section of a webpage showing compatible apps for Jellyfin" width="1902" height="951" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyclients-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyclients-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyclients-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyclients-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyclients-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyclients-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>This had led to a profusion of apps for a variety of purposes. The official Jellyfin Mobile app is great, but if you're more into music, for example, you can use the excellent <a href="https://github.com/dkanada/gelli" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gelli</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Fintunes</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/UnicornsOnLSD/finamp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FinAmp</a>.</p><p>These are all entirely focused on streaming your Jellyfin music collection, creating playlists, and giving you an excellent soundtrack to your life.</p><p>Want a better interface for your movies and shows, but don't care about music? Try <a href="https://github.com/jarnedemeulemeester/findroid" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Findroid</a>. Prefer to access your Jellyfin instance through Kodi?
