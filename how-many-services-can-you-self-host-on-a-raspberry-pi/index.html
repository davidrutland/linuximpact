It gets you out from under the thumb of tech giants who don't have your best interests at heart, and away from the ever-vigilant eyes of surveillance capitalist megacorps that want to make money from your every online interaction, transaction, reaction, and subsequent retraction.</p><p>But more than that, it gives you a kind of digital self reliance, and you have ready-to-go alternatives should legislation or corporate interests shut down your favourite 'free' online services.</p><h2 id="h-why-self-host-on-a-raspberry-pi">Why self-host on a Raspberry Pi?</h2><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72/lightbulb.png" alt="Incandescent lightbulb against a black background" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72/responsive/lightbulb-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72/responsive/lightbulb-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72/responsive/lightbulb-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72/responsive/lightbulb-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72/responsive/lightbulb-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72/responsive/lightbulb-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>The <a href="https://linuximpact.com/tags/raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a> is cheap enough to dabble without feeling like you've made a disastrous financial mistake if it ends up in the back of a cupboard, and there are a lot of Pis out there - meaning that self-hosted software is often built with the Raspberry Pi in mind (often at the back of the mind, but still), and if you run into problems, there's likely someone who has come across the same thing. It's easy to get answers to questions you never knew you had.</p><p>Another reason is the Pi's very low power draw. Our principle Pi - an <a>8GB Raspberry Pi model 4B</a> - pulls under 10 Watts. Remember when your mum used to yell at you for leaving the lights on in your home? The Pi pulls less than a single modern LED lightbulb. It takes one sixth to one tenth of the power of the kind of yellowish incandescent light bulb we grew up with.</p><p>That's important. A server is on 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. While you can easily repurpose an old PC or laptop as a server, any savings you make by not buying a Pi are dwarfed by the electricity bills over the course of a year.</p><p>Lastly, the Pi can handle pretty much anything you can throw at it on the level of a family unit or smallish organisation (the exception being generative AI, which it handles very slowly indeed).</p><p>Writing this paragraph, we don't actually <em>know</em> what we have running on the Linux Impact Raspberry Pi. We decided to take a look, and share the results.</p><h2 id="h-how-our-raspberry-pi-is-set-up">How our Raspberry Pi is set up</h2><p>Our Pi is connected to the router via Gigabit internet.

In addition to the Pi's 8GB RAM, we have 8GB swap. Just in case.</p><p>We haven't overclocked our Pi, because we value stability over speed. Besides, we haven't had the need - yet.</p><p>Base software-wise, we're running a fairly standard LAMP stack based on Debian Bullseye in its guise of Raspberry Pi OS. We're using <a href="https://linuximpact.com/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-docker-compose-on-linux-and-why-you-should/">Docker and Docker Compose</a> to manage a portion of our services.</p><p>Without further ado, let's dive into <strong>/etc/apache2/sites-available/</strong> and see what we have exposed to the web:</p><h2 id="h-nextcloud">Nextcloud</h2><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72//Nextcloud-Logo.jpg" alt="White nextcloud logo on a blue background" width="1200" height="629" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72//responsive/Nextcloud-Logo-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72//responsive/Nextcloud-Logo-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72//responsive/Nextcloud-Logo-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72//responsive/Nextcloud-Logo-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72//responsive/Nextcloud-Logo-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72//responsive/Nextcloud-Logo-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>Nextcloud is the first thing we installed when we started our self-hosted journey some years ago. NextCloud can replace almost every web service out there.</p><p>Forked from OwnCloud, Nextcloud is a Dropbox / Google Drive replacement at its core and helps you synchronise your files and folders across all your devices. But its marketplace of apps, add-ons and extensions makes it so much more than that.</p><p>There's a webmail client, an excellent markdown notes app, recipe manager, Fediverse server and client, spreed-based video conferencing and instant messaging, photo gallery, and a full-fat collaborative office suite courtesy of Collabora Online.</p><p>There's more - a lot more - but we don't have space for it. You can check out the full range of apps at <a href="https://apps.nextcloud.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://apps.nextcloud.com/</a></p><p>Honestly, you could live your self-hosted life without ever using another FAANG company again.</p><p>But while Nextcloud has offerings for pretty much everything, there are other projects dedicated to specific goals that are more polished and them better.

Pi-hole sits between the wider internet, and every machine on our home network.</p><p>Any request to a domain associated with tracking is told to fetch assets from <strong>0.0.0.0</strong> - an IP address that doesn't exist.

It's great for writing a quick note to yourself, or for to-do lists. Memos supports Markdown, checkboxes, and tags. There's also a handy activity indicator, giving a clue as to how many memos we wrote over a given time period (154 memos in 167 days). We could use it to create shopping lists, but we use Mealie for that.</p><p>Again, Memos has a solid mobile app for passing thoughts while we're waiting in traffic.</p><h2 id="h-immich"><a href="https://linuximpact.com/immich-is-the-killer-app-that-will-kick-start-the-self-hosting-revolution/">Immich</a></h2><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72//immich.png" alt="Immich web interface showing images and on this day for various years" width="1915" height="953" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72//responsive/immich-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72//responsive/immich-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72//responsive/immich-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72//responsive/immich-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72//responsive/immich-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/72//responsive/immich-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>Immich is one of the heavyweights, and we're convinced that it's the killer app that can persuade normal people into self-hosting.</p><p>Immich is essentially a Google Photos clone.

Anyone can run their own server and interact with users on other servers. Picture it kind of like Twitter but without a recommendation algorithm, better moderation, and with no overall control.
