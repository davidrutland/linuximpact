                <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Everyone needs a good note-taking app or digital notebook, and for millions of users, Evernote has been the go-to solution since it was envisioned as a "backup brain" by Stepan Pachikov, in 2002, and released on an invitation basis in 2008.</p>
<p>And It's easy to see why Evernote is so popular, thanks to its promise to "give you everything you need to keep life organized—great note taking, project planning, and easy ways to find what you need, when you need it."</p>
<p>Give isn't quite the right word.</p>
<h2 id="h-freemium-saas-isnt-always-great-for-business-and-its-worse-for-users">Freemium SaaS isn't always great for business - and it's worse for users</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/notebook-2.jpg" alt="POV of a person wring in a notebook" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/notebook-2-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/notebook-2-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/notebook-2-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/notebook-2-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/notebook-2-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/notebook-2-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>It's easy to grow your user-base when you give away free subscriptions with phone handsets, and customers get hooked with the inspirational and aspirational slogan that Evernote will help them, "Remember everything. Accomplish anything".</p>
<p>But enshitification inevitably ensues as financial interests force users onto so-called premium plans. Limitations are imposed, and features deprecated.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/evernote-plans.png" alt="Evernote plans ranging from free to 13.49 per month" width="1693" height="844" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/evernote-plans-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/evernote-plans-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/evernote-plans-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/evernote-plans-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/evernote-plans-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/evernote-plans-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Some of those users will pay a premium once their free trial expires, but most probably won't want to fork over more than $100 per year for the privilege - they're happy with the 60 MB monthly uploads, and other limitations. Or they just drift away.</p>
<p>For a while, enough people found Evernote's premium features useful enough to to keep it just about afloat, and in the late 2010s, the company boasted a quarter billion users and a recurring revenue of $100 million - after mass layoffs in 2015 and 2018.</p>
<p>Milan-based app developer, Bending Spoons, acquired Evernote in early 2023, and almost immediately fired a further 129 staff.</p>
<p>Reducing headcount evidently wasn't enough to return the kind of profits the new owners were hoping for, and in an effort to claw more paying subscribers on board, Evernote is limiting the number of notebooks available for free users to a paltry <a href="https://evernote.com/blog/evernote-free-note-limits">50 notes and one notebook</a>.</p>
<p>Want to keep compartmentalised notes for your timetable, meetings, hobbies, pets, and other such essentials? Pay up, loser.</p>
<p>We don't know about you, but we can sometimes write more than 50 notes in a single day. Backup brain? More like back of an envelope.</p>
<p>It's not a good look, and effectively cripples the software unless, of course, you're willing to cough up the cash in monthly installments.</p>
<p>It's not like you can just buy Evernote outright, either. It's a service, and you pay forever.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's a free and open-source Evernote alternative you can run either as a local app, or as a full-blown, cross-platform, synchronised notebook. You don't have to deal with recurring payments, artificial limitations, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Denial of service attacks on the Evernote servers</a>, or the feeling of dread that comes with the knowledge that Evernote will lose your data (<a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/thousands-of-evernote-users-affected-by-data-loss/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">again</a>).</p>
<p>It's yours, it's running on your hardware, and it's a truly excellent alternative to Evernote.</p>
<h2 id="h-trilium-is-the-note-taking-server-app-combo-you-need-right-now">Trilium is the note-taking server app combo you need right now</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/trilium-interface.png" alt="Trilium web interface with the text of this article and an H2 image" width="1918" height="961" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-interface-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-interface-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-interface-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-interface-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-interface-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-interface-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>We don't know how Evernote burns through such an insane amount of money - when revenue in the hundreds of millions isn't enough to sustain a company, it has to go somewhere - and it's possible that server costs contribute to a large part of their expenses. The employees obviously weren't that essential.</p>
<p>But for a single user set-up, running at home, your outlay is essentially zero. You can buy a domain name for pennies or a few dollars from <a href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/m5kVrO">Namecheap</a>, and you can dump server software onto an <a href="https://linuximpact.com/turn-your-old-pc-or-laptop-into-a-server-and-own-your-own-piece-of-the-internet/">old laptop</a> or a cheap, always-on SBC such as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Computer-Suitable-Workstation/dp/B0899VXM8F/ref=sr_1_3?crid=16G7DHNEVDVBH&amp;keywords=raspberry+pi+8gb&amp;qid=1699266630&amp;sprefix=raspberry+pi+8gb%252Caps%252C152&amp;sr=8-3&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=thecrowuk-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=0f9dee46e8b8e6c27a2421c530833bac&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>
<p>So let's talk about <a href="https://github.com/zadam/trilium">Trilium Notes</a>' features.</p>
<p>It's described by the devs as being, "a hierarchical note taking application with focus on building large personal knowledge bases." Not quite as catchy as, "Remember everything. Accomplish anything", but essentially that's what it offers.</p>
<p>That's a pretty accurate description, and essentially means that you write down things that you want to remember, and Trilium gives you a way to keep it all organised. You can create notebooks, and notebooks within those notebooks, ad infinitum. And it's not just notes, either - you can store images, files and arbitrary data, and you can link notes to other notes, and one note can appear in multiple notebooks.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/trilium-notes-map.png" alt="A concept map of Trilium notes" width="1387" height="659" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-notes-map-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-notes-map-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-notes-map-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-notes-map-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-notes-map-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-notes-map-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>It sounds complicated, but it's as complicated or as simple as you want to make it. Keeping track of what you've jotted, photographed, or stored isn't complicated either - there's an excellent search function, as well as a sort-of map view that shows you what is related to what, and how. You can tag, you can filter, and you can find what you're looking for.</p>
<p>Taking notes is easy, too. You can write in markdown, or you can use the excellent WYSIWG editor. Copy and paste, attach files, whatever. It's very easy to use.</p>
<p>Your notes can have infinite children, and they can be anything: code samples, relationship maps, saved searches, or you can embed a webpage with webview.</p>
<p>If you've created a document in Trilium, and decide you want to share it with the world, that's simple as well, and Trilium will generate a link to share your beautifully formatted document as a web page.</p>
<p>That's not to say that Trilium is the perfect note-taking software - it isn't. The web interface is great, the desktop apps are fantastic, but we'd really appreciate some full-fat dedicated mobile apps for iOS and Android. We also think that Evernote's OCR is pretty spiffy, and Trilium would be improved with some similar functionality.</p>
<p>We'd also quite like some support for multiple users on the same instance.</p>
<p>These aren't deal-breakers though, and to our minds, Trilium Notes is still the best around if you don't want to be bled dry by subscriptions.</p>
<p>We're using Trilium Notes to organise our life and our work. We have a dedicated notebook for Linux Impact with sub-notebooks for cool self-hosted projects, TUI stuff, GUI, distros, and so on - all rich, and filled with images, webpages, and random thoughts; We have notebooks for other sites and projects we work on; There are notebooks for upcoming and past holidays; We have timetables, guitar tabs, piano sheet music - all neatly organised and shareable. We'd use Trilium for recipe management, too - except we already have the excellent <a href="https://linuximpact.com/mealie-probably-the-best-self-hosted-recipe-manager-in-the-world/">Mealie self-hosted recipe manager</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the 70th Governor of Massachusetts, we do not have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binders_full_of_women" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">binders full of women</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h-how-to-get-trilium">How to get Trilium</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/trilium-docker-compose.png" alt="Docker Compose file for trilium" width="1393" height="523" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-docker-compose-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-docker-compose-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-docker-compose-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-docker-compose-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-docker-compose-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/70/responsive/trilium-docker-compose-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>If you're planning to use Trilium offline on your local machine, you can grab binaries for Windows, mac, and Linux from the <a href="https://github.com/zadam/trilium/releases/tag/v0.62.3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Trilium releases page</a>. It's fine.</p>
<p>But running a local only copy of Trilium kind of misses the point. You want to be able to take notes while on the bus, or in the cinema, or while having your moustache curled - and have everything sync automatically.</p>
<p>To do that, you need a server, ideally running Linux.</p>
<p>You'll also need to have Docker installed. With that out of the way, you can have Trilium ready to go with a few commands.</p>
<p>The project Github page lists three different ways of deployiing Trilium: local machine only, available on the local network, or open to the internet.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the best and simplest way to set up Trilium is to use the local machine docker command to put it onto your server:</p>
<pre><code>sudo docker run -t -i -p 127.0.0.1:6391:8080 -v ~/trilium/trilium-data:/home/node/trilium-data zadam/trilium:latest</code></pre>
<p>... and stick it behind a reverse proxy. YMMV.</p>
<p>Once Trilum is running, you can <a href="https://linuximpact.com/instantly-generate-configs-from-running-containers-with-docker-autocompose/">use docker-autocompose to generate a <strong>docker-compose.yml</strong> file</a> for easy management.</p>
<p>You can then link your Trilium server to your local clients. Easy peasy.</p>

<p>Unlike with Evernote, you're not limited to what the company wants you to have. Evernote is an open-source project, and even if you don't want to take on the massive responsibility of forking it, you can create add-ons and extensions to make it even more useful than it already is.</p>
<p>Many people have already done this, and you can take advantage of their hard work, to make your Trilium instance more suited to you.</p>
<h3 id="h-some-of-our-favourites-include">Some of our favourites include:</h3>
<h3 id="h-trilium-kanban"><a href="https://github.com/CyrilLeblanc/trilium-kanban" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">trilium-kanban</a></h3>
<p>as the name suggests, this is a Kanban integration for Trilium Notes that makes your workflow ever more efficient.</p>
<h3 id="h-trilium-scripts"><a href="https://github.com/BeatLink/trilium-scripts" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">trilium-scripts</a></h3>
<p>a collection of scripts to turn Trilium into a decent task manager and scheduler. <em>Agenda</em> sorts to-dos into six categories: Overdue, Today, This Week, This Month, This Year, and Future; <em>My Day</em> lets you quickly add or remove tasks to a specific "My Day" note; <em>Recurrence</em> is a script to update repeating to-dos.</p>
<h3 id="h-split-view"><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Split-view</a></h3>
<p>Allows you to hit <strong>Shift </strong>+ <strong>click</strong> to open a note in split view.</p>
<h3 id="h-theme-switch"><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Theme Switch</a></h3>
<p>Gives you a widget to easily change Trilium themes.</p>
<p>You can find these and many more add-ons, themes, widgets, scripts, API extensions at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Awesome Trilium</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h-there-are-self-hosted-alternatives-to-almost-all-proprietary-saas-apps">There are self-hosted alternatives to almost all proprietary SaaS apps</h2>
<p>Relying on companies and organisations to look after your data - whether it's notes, images, or communications - is a losing proposition. You're dependent on their largesse and generosity, and there's always the inevitability that the service will degrade over time, demand fees, or disappear altogether.</p>
<p>Take control of your digital life by <a href="https://linuximpact.com/immich-is-the-killer-app-that-will-kick-start-the-self-hosting-revolution/">self-hosting your own Photo gallery with Immich</a> or your own communications hub with <a href="https://linuximpact.com/set-up-your-own-xmpp-server-on-a-raspberry-pi-in-under-five-minutes/">Snikket</a>. It's easy to do, and you can host almost everything on a cheap Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>For users, deployment is relatively simple. You don't need to chase down dependencies, and you can port your dockerized app from system to system. Often, rolling out a Docker app is as simple as entering a single line specifying the image, volumes, and ports to use.</p>
<p>Docker Compose makes life even simpler, and you can use it to lay out your parameters in a single YAML file, and control your containers with an even shorter command.</p>

<p>Docker Compose is our preferred way of administering the dozens of dockerised apps we use on a daily basis. It's even easier than Docker, and comes with the added bonus that you can manage multiple docker containers simultaneously. Forget typing in lengthy Docker commands - it's all right there in your <strong>docker-compose.yml</strong>.</p>
<p>It's nice when open source projects come with ready made Docker Compose files, but even if they don't you can quickly create your own using docker-autocompose - a Python project that inspects the configurations of containers, and generates the necessary config - provided you already have your Docker container running, that is.</p>

<p>Before you start, you should make sure you have both <a href="https://linuximpact.com/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-docker-compose-on-linux-and-why-you-should/">Docker and Docker Compose</a> on your system.</p>
<p>docker-autocompose is a Python app, so you should also have Python3 and Pip. If you're using Ubuntu or Debian, you can install these with:</p>
<pre data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><code>sudo apt install python3-pip</code></pre>
<p>With that out of the way, clone the docker-autocompose Git repository, and move into it:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Red5d/docker-autocompose.git &amp;&amp; cd docker-autocompose.git</code></pre>
<p>Install docker-autocompose with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo python3 setup.py install</code></pre>
<h2 id="h-how-to-use-docker-autocompose">How to use docker-autocompose</h2>
<p>There's no better way to explain something than with an example, so we're going deploy a dockerised app on our Raspberry Pi server and use docker-autocompose to create a docker-compose.yml file.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/69/trilium.jpg" alt="trilum note taking app in the browser" width="1919" height="969" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/69/responsive/trilium-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/69/responsive/trilium-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/69/responsive/trilium-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/69/responsive/trilium-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/69/responsive/trilium-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/69/responsive/trilium-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Trilium Notes is an open-source note-taking app you can self-host, and is compatible with clients for <a href="https://github.com/zadam/trilium-sender">Andoid</a>,<a href="https://github.com/zadam/trilium-sender"></a> and various desktop operating systems, as well as having an excellent web app that looks good and works well on both mobile and full-fat browsers. It's a fantastic and free alternative to Evernote or OneNote that you can use <span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">without any restrictions or fees. Trilium is also massively extensible with themes, widgets, scripts, and API extensions available.</span></p>
<p>While the Trilium developers have created a dockerised version of the notes server for easy deployment, they haven't created a Docker Compose file for easy management. Drat - but we can fix that.</p>
<p>First deploy the Trilium Docker container in something approximating the recommended way:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir trilium &amp;&amp; cd trilium</code></pre>
<pre><code>sudo docker run -t -i -p 127.0.0.1:6391:8080 -v ~/trilium/trilium-data:/home/node/trilium-data zadam/trilium:latest</code></pre>
<p>Note that we've specified port 6391 as our external port - that's simply because we already have something running on port 8080. You can also change the location where you want Trilium to keep its data. We've created a Trilium directory and specified the data directory should go in there.</p>
<p>Later, it's where our Trilium <strong>docker-compose.yml</strong> file will reside. Hit <strong>enter</strong> and Docker will download the Trilium images and set up the necessary containers and data directory.</p>
<p>Visit localhost:6391 to check Trilium is running, then in another terminal tab or window, enter:</p>
<pre data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><code>docker ps</code></pre>
<p>This command will give you information on all of the docker containers running on your system. Take a note of the <strong>Container ID</strong>, then enter:</p>
<pre><code>autocompose.py container-id</code></pre>
<figure class="post__image"><img  style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal); outline: 3px solid rgba(var(--color-primary-rgb), 0.55) !important;" src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/69/create-docker-compose-for-trilium.png" alt="Output of the commands docker ps and autocompose.py 698bc65f6b12" width="1920" height="1051" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/69/responsive/create-docker-compose-for-trilium-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/69/responsive/create-docker-compose-for-trilium-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/69/responsive/create-docker-compose-for-trilium-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/69/responsive/create-docker-compose-for-trilium-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/69/responsive/create-docker-compose-for-trilium-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/69/responsive/create-docker-compose-for-trilium-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>This command will return a complete Docke<span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">r Compose config as stdout.</span></p>
<p>Copy this text to your clipboard, then use nano <span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">to create a new file:</span></p>
<pre><code>nano docker-compose.yml</code></pre>
<p>Paste the contents of your clipboard then save and close nano with <strong>Ctrl + O</strong> then <strong>Ctrl + X</strong>.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">In our case, the resulting Docker Compose file for Trilium is:</p>
<pre><code>services:
  nervous_joliot:
    command:
      - "./start-docker.sh"
    container_name: "nervous_joliot"
    entrypoint:
      - "docker-entrypoint.sh"
    environment:
      - "PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
      - "NODE_VERSION=18.18.2"
      - "YARN_VERSION=1.22.19"
    hostname: "698bc65f6b12"
    image: "zadam/trilium:latest"
    ipc: "private"
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options: {}
    mac_address: "02:42:ac:11:00:02"
    network_mode: "bridge"
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:6391:8080/tcp"
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    volumes:
      - "/home/pi/trilium/trilium-data:/home/node/trilium-data"
    working_dir: "/usr/src/app"
version: "3.6"
 </code></pre>
<p>You can now destroy your old and uncool docker container, and bring up your fancy new one in detached mode with a simple:</p>
<pre><code>docker-compose up -d </code></pre>
<p>Remember to properly configure a reverse proxy if you plan on exposing Trilium to the web.</p>
<h2 id="h-docker-compose-makes-container-orchestration-simple">Docker Compose makes container orchestration simple</h2>
<p>Now you can create Docker Compose files from any running Docker container, and add to your easily managed arsenal of dockerised and self-hosted apps.

                <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Ah, December. The most wonderful time of the year... unless you're one of those people who celebrates Christmas or Hanukkah. Even if you don't celebrate anything, there are still plenty of reasons to feel festive this month. For example, the solstice happens on December 21st, which means we get an extra second to enjoy our favorite Netflix shows before bedtime. Plus, there's always New Year's Eve, where you can either stay up until midnight and ring in the new year with champagne and confetti, or go to sleep at midnight like a normal person. Either way, it's a win-win.</p>
<p>Here's your December horoscope cast by me, Mystic Mog, an AI generated psychic cat, powered by <strong>TheBloke_Luna-AI-Llama2-Uncensored-GPTQ model</strong>, so you should ignore the <em>not by AI</em> tag above this post. I specialise in reading the future using methods such as divining the stars, reading tea leaves, and casting bones.</p>
<h2 class="username">Here's what the stars have planned for you in December 2023</h2>
<p>Welcome to the final stretch of 2023! As we approach the winter solstice and the end of the year, many of us are feeling both excited and anxious about what lies ahead. This month's horoscope is here to help you navigate these emotions and set intentions for the future. Whether you're looking forward to starting a new chapter or dreading saying goodbye to old ones, know that you're not alone in this journey. Let's make the most of the remaining days of 2023 together.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Aries (March 21-April 19)</strong>: Hey Aries, you're like a wildfire burning bright this December. You've got passion and intensity on your side, so go out there and make some serious moves. Just be careful not to burn yourself or anyone else in the process.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Taurus (April 20-May 20)</strong>: Hey there, Taurus. You're looking good this month. The stars are aligned just right for you to have lots of sexy times with your partner(s). In fact, it's so hot that even the fire department wants to get in on the action. So go ahead and enjoy yourself - no one will judge you here. Just remember to use protection and don't forget to brush your teeth afterwards.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success"><strong>Gemini (May 21-June 20)</strong>:The unexpected twists and turns this month might leave you feeling a bit dizzy, but don't worry - it's just life imitating art. Or maybe it's the other way around.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Cancer (June 21-July 22)</strong>: Even though you're used to being the rock in everyone else's world, this month you'll need to rely on others to help keep you steady. But hey, that's what friends are for, right?</p>
<p class="msg--highlight msg "><strong>Leo (July 23-August 22)</strong>: It's time to strut your stuff and show off your best qualities. But let's face it - you already knew that. What you might not realize is that everyone else is secretly jealous of how amazing you look right now. So enjoy the attention while it lasts, because soon enough they'll be coming after you again</p>
<p class="msg msg--success"><strong>Virgo (August 23-September 22)</strong>: Hey Virgo, you're like a fine wine - getting better with age. This month, expect some unexpected opportunities to come your way, but be sure not to get too excited or you might spill that wine all over yourself.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Libra (September 23-October 22)</strong>: Oh Libra, you're so vain. You think this zodiac sign is about you? Well guess what, it's not. This month, prepare for some serious competition from other signs who are also vying for your attention. But hey, at least you'll have something to talk about at parties.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Scorpio (October 23-November 21)</strong>: Scorpio, you're like a cockroach - nobody really likes you, but everyone fears you. This month, expect some intense emotions to arise as you navigate through life's challenges. Just remember, no matter how tough things get, you always have your trusty tail to hold on to.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success"><strong>Sagittarius (November 22-December 21)</strong>: Sagittarius, you're like a telemarketer - you call it as you see it, even if people don't want to hear it. This month, expect some difficult conversations as you try to impart wisdom onto those around you. But hey, at least you're making an effort to improve their lives, right?</p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Capricorn (December 22-January 19)</strong>: Congratulations Capricorn, you did it! You made it through another year of being fabulous and amazing. This month, celebrate your successes and enjoy the moment because soon enough, you'll be looking back on this time as just another chapter in your incredible story.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Aquarius (January 20 - February 18)</strong>: Aquarius, you're like a broken vase - you may look beautiful on the outside, but inside you're cracked and fragile. This month, expect some unexpected setbacks as you try to maintain control over your life. Are you strong enough to keep going despite everything?</p>
<p class="msg msg--success"><strong>Pisces (February 19 - March 20)</strong>: Dear Pisces, this month you will be visited by three wise men who will bring you gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. However, they won't be able to find you because you'll be hiding under a rock crying about how much you hate yourself. Don't worry though, it's just another opportunity for you to practice self-love and acceptance.</p>
<p class="dropcap">Overall, December is a great month for introspection and reflection as we prepare for the end of the year and start thinking about what we want to accomplish in the next one. There may be some challenges along the way (hello, Capricorn season), but ultimately, it's a time of growth and transformation. So embrace the change and enjoy the ride!</p>

<p>With Pyphoon, you can easily track, predict, and visualise phases of the moon via delightful ASCII art, without ever leaving your Linux terminal.</p>
<h2 id="h-whats-so-great-about-the-moon">What's so great about the moon?</h2>

<p>Everything on the planet is affected by the moon. From tidal stresses deep in the earth's crust, to the waves that overtop the sea wall during a storm.</p>
<p>Our early ancestors hunted by the light of the moon, and later, with the development of agriculture, timed the turning of the seasons, and the planting of crops.</p>
<p>Even today, the lunar calendar is used by several major religions and cultures to schedule festivals, celebrations, and other significant events.</p>
<p>Countless column inches are given over to horoscopes every day, so its no surprise that people of a mystical mindset - including the Linux Impact <a href="https://linuximpact.com/tags/horoscope/">AI psychic cat</a> - are interested in its current phase.</p>
<p>And you can't time your next werewolf transformation for minimum embarrassment or maximum mayhem without knowing when the next full moon is.</p>
<h2 id="h-pyphoon-gives-you-an-ascii-moon-in-your-terminal">Pyphoon gives you an ASCII moon in your terminal</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/67/cloudymoon.png" alt="The moon behind clouds as seen through trees" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/67/responsive/cloudymoon-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/67/responsive/cloudymoon-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/67/responsive/cloudymoon-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/67/responsive/cloudymoon-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/67/responsive/cloudymoon-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/67/responsive/cloudymoon-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>What's the point? you may ask. After all, it's trivial to draw back the curtains or step outside to check the moon's current phase.</p>
<p>But sometimes the moon isn't visible. You won't be able to see the moon if it's at its zenith during your lunch break, nor if it's on the other side of the planet.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's cloudy, and while you may be able to discern its glow through the clouds, you can't tell its phase.</p>
<p>Sure you could query your favourite search engine, but that would involve leaving your beloved Linux terminal.</p>
<p>Pyphoon is a Python app to show you the phase of the moon as an ASCII art representation, and is the latest incarnation of a 1979 programme written in Pascal, and later C.</p>
<p>Did you know that the orientation of the moon is reversed depending on which hemisphere you're in? We didn't, but it makes sense, and Pymoon will change your terminal moon's appearance accordingly.</p>
<p>Pymoon will also show the moon phase for any date you care to give it, so if you need a visual representation of the moon phase for your next date night or anniversary, Pyphoon is exactly the tool you need.</p>

<p>If your distro comes with support for snap packages (and you haven't disabled it), the easiest way to install Pyphoon is to pop open a terminal and enter:</p>
<pre data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><code>sudo snap install pyphoon --edge</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise, make sure you have git, python, and pip installed, then enter:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/chubin/pyphoon &amp;&amp; cd pyphoon
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install</code></pre>
<p>That's it. You can start Pyphoon by entering:</p>
<pre><code>pyphoon</code></pre>
<p>...in any terminal window.</p>

<p>The previous command gets you the current phase of the moon in the northern hemisphere, along with associated information including the time since the last full moon and last quarter.</p>
<p>That may not be exactly what you need.</p>
<p>To view the moon phase on a current date - either in the future or the past, use the desired date as an argument. For instance, to find the moon phase on the very first Christmas day, enter:</p>
<pre><code>pyphoon 01-12-25</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately Pyphoon doesn't accept dates pre-common era. So if you were planning on use it to look at the moon as dinosaurs, Moses, Hammurabi, or Qin Shi Huang would have seen it, you're out of luck.</p>
<p>Supposedly the, -l or --language switch followed by your preferred language switches the language, but we were unable to make this work.</p>
<p>Adding <strong>-x</strong> will show you the moon phase for your given date without additional information, while the -s switch allows you to specify whether you're in the northern or the southern hemisphere (it's north by default).</p>
<p>If you wanted to see the moon as it appeared when James cook first set foot on the Australian landmass at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Beach_(New_South_Wales)">Silver Beach</a>, you could enter:</p>
<pre><code>pyphoon 1770-04-29 -x -s south</code></pre>
<p>Neato.</p>
<p>For some extra-awesome, try using cool-retro-term to view the moon phase as it was on July 20th, 1969, and pretend you're behind a desk in mission control.</p>
<h2 id="h-pyphoon-isnt-the-only-cool-terminal-tool-out-there">Pyphoon isn't the only cool terminal tool out there</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular opinion, the Linux terminal is a tremendously fun place to hang out, and you can live a fulfilled and happy life without ever leaving the command line.</p>

                <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">In the world of self-hosted streamable media, Plex is often cited as the dominant player - boasting 16 million active monthly users across the world.</p>
<p>It offers an easy-to-deploy server system, through which you can stream your own media to friends and family, as well as streaming licensed shows through the wider network.</p>
<p>But to many, Plex is a problematic platform - and to use it you may have to make compromises on privacy, as well as potentially expose yourself to legal action.</p>
<h2 id="h-self-hosting-your-own-services-grants-you-freedom-from-exploitation">Self-hosting your own services grants you freedom from exploitation</h2>
<p>Self-hosting your own services to replace those provided tech giants such as Google, Twitter, Netflix, and Amazon is a great hobby.</p>
<p>Even on something as basic as an old, <a href="https://linuximpact.com/turn-your-old-pc-or-laptop-into-a-server-and-own-your-own-piece-of-the-internet/">unloved laptop</a>, or a bargain basement single board computer such as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Computer-Suitable-Workstation/dp/B0899VXM8F/ref=sr_1_3?crid=16G7DHNEVDVBH&amp;keywords=raspberry+pi+8gb&amp;qid=1699266630&amp;sprefix=raspberry+pi+8gb%252Caps%252C152&amp;sr=8-3&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=thecrowuk-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=0f9dee46e8b8e6c27a2421c530833bac&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Raspberry Pi</a> (affiliate link), you can run your own communications network over <a href="https://linuximpact.com/set-up-your-own-xmpp-server-on-a-raspberry-pi-in-under-five-minutes/">XMPP</a> with video, audio, and text chat; deploy Immich as a vastly <a href="https://linuximpact.com/immich-is-the-killer-app-that-will-kick-start-the-self-hosting-revolution/">superior alternative to Google Photos</a>; push Amazon's Audible out of the picture with <a href="https://linuximpact.com/self-host-your-own-audio-library-with-audiobookshelf/">Audiobookshelf</a>; and free yourself from the tyranny of Jamie Oliver with a variety of <a href="https://linuximpact.com/self-hosted-recipe-managers-to-make-cooking-a-joy/">self-hosted recipe managers</a>.</p>
<p>By running your own services on your own hardware, you're not being tracked across the internet by entities that do not have your best interests at heart, you're not having adverts shoved down your throat, and you're not paying subscription fees beyond those required for a bargain domain name from <a href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/m5kVrO">NameCheap</a> (another affiliate link).</p>
<p>In addition to the services mentioned above, you can also replace Netflix and Amazon Prime videos with... <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a>?</p>
<h2 id="h-plex-has-problems">What's wrong with Plex?</h2>
<p>Plex has a long and storied history that begins in 2007, with two projects to port XMBC to macOS merged to create OSXBMC - later named Plex.</p>
<p>The aim was simple: give users more control over their media. Plex boasted dozens of individual apps, helping users to access streaming content, trailers and manage their media. In 2009, Plex was incorporated as a private company.</p>
<p>While the popularity of Plex continued to grow, a number of questionable decisions were made. These rankle with us. They might not bother you in the slightest.</p>
<p>The allure of self-hosting is that your media is running on your hardware. It's supposed to give you absolute independence, privacy, and anonymity: Download, install, stream - and it's nobody's business but yours.</p>
<p>Plex, on the other hand, is a mess of upselling and dubious privacy options.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article, we (partially) ran through the installation process so you don't have to.</p>
<h2 id="h-a-plex-privacy-problem">A Plex privacy problem</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//plex_website.png" alt="The front page of plex.tv showing cookie consent and Google signin popups" width="1914" height="949" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex_website-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex_website-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex_website-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex_website-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex_website-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex_website-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Finding Plex was easy enough. We typed "Plex media server" into DuckDuckGo (other search engines are available), and clicked on the top result. So far, so straightforward, but we were immediately greeted by a banner promising an "Upgrade to a Lifetime Plex Pass for 25% off. <strong>Upgrade Now!</strong>" No thanks.</p>
<p>Scrolling down to select our server type, we were twice more offered the opportunity to "Get a Plex Pass to access exclusive preview downloads. Sign in with a Plex Pass enabled account to access exclusive preview downloads." Again, we'll pass thanks.</p>
<p>We selected <strong>Linux</strong> as our platform, confirmed that we were at least 13 years old, and proceeded to download the <strong>deb</strong> file for our virtual Ubuntu system.</p>
<p>We Installed with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/plex*</code></pre>
<p>...and attempted to start Plex from the system menu.</p>
<p>But Plex did not start.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//plex-account-creation.png" alt="Plex account signin screen" width="1189" height="672" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex-account-creation-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex-account-creation-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex-account-creation-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex-account-creation-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex-account-creation-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/plex-account-creation-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Instead, a new browser window opened to app.plex.tv, with a message stating that "<strong>Plex web</strong> would like to sign into your Plex account".</p>
<p>We were given the option of signing in via Google, Facebook, Apple, or email.</p>
<p>We don't have a Plex account and don't especially want one either. There seems to be little point in going down the self-hosted route, then relying on a corporate third party to gain access to our own media. We also feel it may not be immediately obvious to all users that they're on an external site.</p>
<p>Below this dazzling array of sign-in options is the disclaimer that "By creating an account or continuing to use a Plex application, website, or software, you acknowledge and agree that you have accepted the Terms of Service and have reviewed the Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>These are not short documents, but highlights include who the company shares your data with. This includes payment processors, business and analytics providers, content providers, marketers, and cloud service providers, third parties to improve and deliver advertising to you on our behalf and on behalf of others.</p>
<p>They'll also cough up your deets to, "satisfy an applicable law, regulation, legal process, or valid governmental request; or protect or defend the safety, rights, or property of Plex, the public, or any person".</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//police_bike.png" alt="NYPD police motorcycle speeding against a blurred background" width="2000" height="1000" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/police_bike-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/police_bike-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/police_bike-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/police_bike-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/police_bike-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/police_bike-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>That's an awful lot of sharing, and an awful lot of marketing. And do keep in mind the provenance of your self-hosted material in case it becomes the subject of a government request, or infringes the rights of any other organisation.</p>
<p>You can, of course, delete your personal information from Plex, "except that we may retain archived copies as required by law".</p>
<p>Well, shit.</p>
<p>In section M, the policy states that Plex (the company) does not collect "content titles of your Personal Content" or "Filenames EXCEPT those that may be collected under Debugging Information below."</p>
<p>Scroll down to the <strong>Debugging Information</strong> section, and you'll see that this includes, "logs, crash reports, or other information about your devices, media, and experiences".</p>
<p>While the policy goes on to state that, "it is for the sole purpose of resolving technical issues with the software", we'd hate to speculate how this would stand against the requirement to "satisfy an applicable law, regulation, legal process, or valid governmental request".</p>
<p>In our opinion, your logs shouldn't be anywhere near the Plex company servers, lest any passing rights-holder take exception to your <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/its-still-illegal-to-rip-dvd-and-blu-ray-discs-for-personal-use/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">illegally ripped Blu-rays</a>.</p>
<p>Lacking either Google, Facebook, or Apple accounts, we used one of our many <a href="https://linuximpact.com/protect-your-inbox-from-spam-and-online-threats/">email aliases</a>, and were then redirected to a localhost address to learn "How Plex Works".</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//how-plex-works.png" alt="An infographic describing how plex works" width="1210" height="684" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/how-plex-works-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/how-plex-works-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/how-plex-works-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/how-plex-works-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/how-plex-works-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/how-plex-works-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>We clicked the big orange "Got it" button and were subject to yet another full-screen Plex Pass advert offering an array of benefits including parental controls, offline media downloads, live TV and DVR.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//yet-another-plexpass-ad.png" alt="Plexpass advert with a variety of payment options" width="1211" height="682" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/yet-another-plexpass-ad-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/yet-another-plexpass-ad-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/yet-another-plexpass-ad-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/yet-another-plexpass-ad-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/yet-another-plexpass-ad-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/yet-another-plexpass-ad-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>There are three large payment option buttons, and a tiny white <strong>X </strong>in the corner to get rid of the thing. This is what is known a <em>dark pattern</em>.</p>
<p>We didn't go any further than that - partially because we don't want what is supposedly <em>our</em> media server to scan <em>our</em> movies and forward any logs the Plex central, and partly because we'd need to enable DRM to use the damned thing.</p>
<p>How long is a lifetime anyway? Is it your lifetime? Their lifetime? </p>
<h2 id="h-another-plex-privacy-problem">A public Plex privacy problem</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//skinemax.png" alt="A selection of softcore skinemax movie covers" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/skinemax-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/skinemax-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/skinemax-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/skinemax-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/skinemax-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/skinemax-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>As a private company employing around 100 people, Plex has an obligation to make money. Selling a lifetime Plex pass gets them a one-off payment of around $100, and if you're committed to the Plex ecosystem, it makes sense to choose this option rather than monthly or yearly subscriptions.</p>
<p>But for it to be worth it for the company, their user base needs to grow.</p>
<p>People love to be part of a club, and to engage in the same or similar activities as their friends and acquaintances. They like recommendations, and things to talk about over the weekly Sunday get-together.</p>
<p>The Plex Discover service launched in March 2022 and allowed users to see what was new and trending across all of their subscribed services.</p>
<p>And in a November 2023 blog post, the company expanded the scope of Discover, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can all agree that we love seeing a Fresh Tomato score, but nothing compares to those IRL conversations on Monday morning (remember those?) where we stand around (instead of working) and review—mano a mano—what we watched all weekend. Let’s call it the Water Cooler Effect...Sure, our curation is done by real humans, and our recommendations span the services you watch most, but add in the stuff your friends are watching and rating? That’s gold, Jerry! Gold!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's certainly gold for someone, but as reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/plex-users-fear-discover-together-week-in-review-feature-will-leak-porn-habits-to-their-friends-and-family/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">404 media</a>, users are discovering that Discover lets friends and family discover the smut you've been playing on Plex.</p>
<p>The company later clarified to 404 that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plex does not generate community activity for known adult titles. The 'skinemax' type content you refer to in the article may not all be tagged as adult, so that is why these titles may surface in watch activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough, but it's still embarrassing to talk to your uncle at the next family gathering when you know he's been asked to give a thumbs up to your viewing of<em> Bikini Chain Gang (Hard Love, Hard Time)</em>. And that water cooler chat in work could be agonisingly awkward when you know that your line manager spent the weekend binging such skinemax classics as <em>Secret Games ( Take a ride to the dark side of desire)</em>, <em>Secret Games 2 ( The darkest side of desire)</em>, and <em>Secret Games 3 (Revisit the dark side of desire)</em>.</p>
<h2 id="h-why-you-should-use-jellyfin-instead-of-plex">Why you should use Jellyfin instead of Plex?</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//jellyfin.png" alt="A jellyfin instance with sections for movies, music, and shows " width="1902" height="906" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyfin-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyfin-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyfin-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyfin-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyfin-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyfin-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>We could spend all day enumerating the reasons why Plex is not our preferred server for self-hosted streaming hijinks. Instead we're going to say why Jellyfin <em>is </em>our media server of choice.</p>
<p>It starts with the installation process: Visit <a href="https://jellyfin.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://jellyfin.org/</a>, and select your server type. There's no pass involved, and no upselling. Lifetime access? Screw that, it's built in. Just download and install the usual way.</p>
<p>If you run Linux, you don't even need to visit the site: open a terminal and if you're on a Debian-based system, enter:</p>
<pre><code>curl https://repo.jellyfin.org/install-debuntu.sh | sudo bash</code></pre>
<p>Boom. Done. You can create an admin account through the browser. The Jellyfin devs don't know you've created an account (it's on your server, not theirs) - nor do they particularly care. No-one gets your movie titles, or your metadata, or anything else. If you want to upload your logs for help with troubleshooting, you can, that's on you. No-one's forcing you.</p>
<p>Let's talk about extras for a minute - the kind of feature you'd pay for on Plex.</p>
<p>Watching and recording live TV? Yes, you can do that. Downloading media onto any device? Hell yes.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//kid.png" alt="A child using an imac with a gigantic screen" width="2000" height="1000" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/kid-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/kid-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/kid-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/kid-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/kid-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/kid-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Got kids and want to restrict what they can watch? Create a Jellyfin profile for them, and set a maximum allowed parental rating, or restrict based on tags. You can even make an access schedule, where media can only play during specific periods, and will be stopped past it.</p>
<p>We ran through the entirety of what the Plex pass <em>allows</em> you to do on your server, and as far as we can tell, Jellyfin has most of it baked in. It's common-sense stuff, and the kind of useful feature that should be available as part of any basic package.</p>
<p>One area in which Jellyfin positively excels in comparison to Plex is with third party apps. You can use Plex through your browser or with an officially supported Plex app. With Jellyfin, anyone can make a comptible app and put it on the app / play store or on F-Droid.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//jellyclients.png" alt="Section of a webpage showing compatible apps for Jellyfin" width="1902" height="951" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyclients-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyclients-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyclients-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyclients-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyclients-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/66//responsive/jellyclients-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>This had led to a profusion of apps for a variety of purposes. The official Jellyfin Mobile app is great, but if you're more into music, for example, you can use the excellent <a href="https://github.com/dkanada/gelli" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gelli</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Fintunes</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/UnicornsOnLSD/finamp" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FinAmp</a>.</p>
<p>These are all entirely focused on streaming your Jellyfin music collection, creating playlists, and giving you an excellent soundtrack to your life.</p>
<p>Want a better interface for your movies and shows, but don't care about music? Try <a href="https://github.com/jarnedemeulemeester/findroid" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Findroid</a>. Prefer to access your Jellyfin instance through Kodi? There's an unofficial <a href="https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-kodi" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">add-on</a>.</p>
<p>Jellyfin music in your Linux terminal? You need <a href="https://github.com/tryffel/jellycli" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Jellycli</a>. For audiobooks, <a href="https://github.com/JellyBookOrg/JellyBook" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">JellyBook</a> handles most formats well.</p>
<p>There's an incomplete list of official and third-party clients <a href="https://jellyfin.org/downloads/clients/all" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. Check it out, then check out <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/203082707-supported-plex-companion-apps/">Plex's list of companion apps</a> (some will require a Plex pass to function)</p>
<h2 id="h-freemium-vs-open-source">Freemium vs open source</h2>
<p>If you're happy with the privacy trade-offs offered by Plex, it may be the ideal home streaming solution for you. And paying for a pass means you have some kind of piece of mind (as well as freedom from the ever-present prompts to upgrade).</p>
<p>But Plex offers little over and above what you'd get with Jellyfin, and comes at a pretty precarious potential price to your privacy. If you feel bad about not paying for software, you can always <a href="https://opencollective.com/jellyfin" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">donate to Jellyfin</a> to help keep the servers running and the devs fully caffeinated.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/deep5050/radio-active" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Radio-active</a> is built using Python and is installed using the Pip package manager, so make sure you have it on your machine before you start. You'll also need ffmpeg - a set of libraries and command-line tools for AV processing, conversion, and streaming.</p>
<p>All the necessary tools should be available in your default repositories.</p>
<p>Install Radio-active with:</p>
<pre><code>pipx install radio-active</code></pre>
<p>That's it!</p>
<h2 id="h-listen-to-internet-radio-in-your-linux-terminal-with-radio-active">Listen to internet radio in your Linux terminal with Radio-active</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/65/radioactive-interface.png" alt="radioactive search results for GB stations ordered by votes" width="1196" height="614" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/65/responsive/radioactive-interface-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/65/responsive/radioactive-interface-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/65/responsive/radioactive-interface-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/65/responsive/radioactive-interface-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/65/responsive/radioactive-interface-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/65/responsive/radioactive-interface-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>You can start Radio-active by typing:</p>
<pre><code>radio</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>radioactive</code></pre>
<p>...into your terminal. You'll see an informative TUI, and the message "No stations to play. Please search for a station first!"</p>
<p>It's a self-explanatory message, and there are a number of ways to search for stations.</p>
<p>The easiest way is to use the <strong>--search</strong> or <strong>-S</strong> flagsand enter your radio station by name. For instance, if you have a hankering for BBC Radio 2 you would enter:</p>
<pre><code>radio -S 'BBC radio 2'</code></pre>
<p>Radio-active will return a table of radio stations with that name, along with an ID number, broadcast country, and tags. Select a number from the list to start listening. A selection of modern and classic pop hits will instantly fill your ears.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/65/deepvibes.png" alt="deepvibes internet radio playing through radioactive" width="1195" height="262" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/65/responsive/deepvibes-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/65/responsive/deepvibes-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/65/responsive/deepvibes-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/65/responsive/deepvibes-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/65/responsive/deepvibes-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/65/responsive/deepvibes-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Alternatively, you can search by country using <strong>--country</strong> or <strong>-C</strong>, followed by<strong> </strong>your preferred nation's country code. To see a list of streaming stations from the UK, you would enter</p>
<pre><code>radio -C GB</code></pre>
<p>Maybe you don't have a particular station or even a country in mind, in which case you can use the <strong>--tag</strong>, or <strong>--language</strong> switches to narrow down your hunt.</p>
<p>To add a station to your <strong>favourites</strong> list, just hit the <strong>f</strong> key (and pay your respects) while the station is playing.</p>
<p>Once you've added some favourites, you can view and stream them by starting Radio-active without any arguments, or just view them with:</p>
<pre><code>radio --list </code></pre>
<p>If you love what you're listening to, you can record the stream by hitting the <strong>r </strong>key. MP3 files are saved to <strong>~/Music/radioactive</strong>.</p>
<p>One minor annoyance is that the search table is limited to 100 results. A search for <strong>GB</strong> stations returns an alphabetic list doesn't even make it further than Angel radio. There doesn't seem to be any way of combining search functionality, by which we mean that entering:</p>
<pre><code>radio --tag classical --country GB</code></pre>
<p>...will not return a list of UK stations tagged as classical. One of the search criteria will be ignored.</p>
<p>You can, however, sort the results according to certain factors including <strong>votes</strong>, <strong>bitrate</strong>, <strong>clickcount</strong>, and <strong>random</strong>. For example:</p>
<p>radio --tag pop --sort votes</p>
<p>returns a table of the 100 most popular stations tagged as "pop"</p>
<h2 id="h-radio-active-is-being-actively-developed">Radio-active is being actively developed</h2>
<p>Radio-active is hands-down the best internet radio TUI we've played with, but it isn't perfect. Development is ongoing, and you can see the developer's todo list <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.

<p>Ever felt the need to declare that you're not a robot? We certainly haven't - our physical presence, general awkwardness, along with the complete lack of a shiny skeleton and Austrian accent indicate that we're genuine humans</p>

<h2 id="h-on-the-internet-no-one-knows-youre-a-dog">On the internet, no-one knows you're a probability engine...</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/irobot.jpeg" alt="A cyborg facing the viewer while writing a blog post on a mac" width="4096" height="2048" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/irobot-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/irobot-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/irobot-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/irobot-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/irobot-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/irobot-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>ChatGPT from OpenAI came onto the scene almost a year ago on November 30th 2022, and it's impossible to overstate how profoundly it altered the media landscape, work, and entire economies - as well as what you read and how you interact with your fellow humans.</p>
<p>Sure, we'd seen approximations of artificial intelligence in the wild before. Most notable was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35902104">Microsoft's Tay chatbot</a> - modeled on an an American teenage girl.</p>
<p>Described as "The AI with zero chill", and loosed on the world through the questionable medium of Twitter, Tay quickly become a racist, xenophobic, sex-obsessed Hitler fan. We have no experience with American teenage girls, so are unable to say whether this is typical or not. Either way, Microsoft shut down the bot with extreme prejudice a day later.</p>
<p>ChatGPT is different. You can hold coherent conversations, it can summarise documents, tell you facts, or convincingly pretend to be other people. It's a revelation, and a miracle of the mid-21st century.</p>
<p>Within weeks, the company formerly known as FaceBook revealed that it too had been working on AI, and shortly afterwards, LLaMA was unleashed.</p>
<p>Now, if you need to write a college application essay but have left it until 11.59 on deadline day, you can have one of the many AI web services knock one out in a few seconds; if you need an award-winning photograph or artistic masterpiece, Dall-E or Stable diffusion can generate one in a few minutes.</p>
<p>This writer keeps offline versions of Stable Diffusion, and an uncensored LLaMA model for shits and giggles. It's trivial to give it a persona, ask it a question and have your pet AI answer in character.</p>
<h2 id="h-ai-is-flooding-the-zone-with-shit">AI is flooding the zone with shit</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/shitflood.jpeg" alt="AI generated image for the prompt - flooding the zone with shit - showing a car driving through brown water in a suburban area" width="4096" height="2048" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/shitflood-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/shitflood-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/shitflood-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/shitflood-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/shitflood-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/shitflood-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Traffic is the lifeblood of the internet, and the more traffic you can generate, the more money you can make for your shareholders.</p>
<p>Typically, this content is generated by writers, artists, poets, photographers, and other creative types. Generally, you have to pay them to produce the kind of work that draws in visitors.</p>
<p>AI though? AI generated content is free. Sure, you need to pay a subscription for access to the the latest models and reliable service, but if you don't mind joining the queue and putting up with spotty availability, you can create passable content with ease.</p>
<p>And passable is about as good as it gets. Reliable? Not really - we're sure you recall the comedy that ensued when New York lawyer, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-65735769" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Steven A Schwartz</a> was asked to research cases for a colleague, and turned to ChatGPT instead. Non-existent cases were cited in court, and the lawyers were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/nyregion/lawyer-chatgpt-sanctions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">publicly bollocked at a special hearing</a> (paywall link).</p>
<p>Using AI to cite case law is high stakes, and comes with high risks - if you're a media outlet, then as long as you're not libeling anyone, it doesn't seem quite so important.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/cnet-is-testing-an-ai-engine-heres-what-weve-learned-mistakes-and-all/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">CNET's attempt to write articles using "AI Assist"</a>, were highly publicised and they were ridiculed for their mistakes - but CNET was one of the first, it's unlikely to be the last. Most outlets probably won't even acknowledge that they're using AI tools.</p>
<p>Newsquest is the second largest publisher of regional and local newspapers in the UK. It's owned by US media giant Gannett - a company that you might recall was looking to hire <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230912203956/https://us231.dayforcehcm.com/CandidatePortal/en-US/gannett/Posting/View/63544" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">a full-time, video forward Taylor Swift Reporter</a>, shortly after laying off nearly 10% of its staff.</p>
<p>In September, Newsquest <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">advertised for an AI-assisted reporter</a> to, "be at the forefront of a new era in journalism, utilising AI technology to create national, local, and hyper-local content for our news brands, while also applying their traditional journalism skills."</p>
<p>The advert was still up as of November 2023, and we look forward to seeing the "AI-assisted" disclaimer when a suitable candidate is eventually hired. We won't though.</p>
<h2 id="h-what-does-it-mean-to-be-human">What does it mean to be human?</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/pensive.jpeg" alt="An AI generated image for the prompt - What does it mean to be human - featuring a dark-haired lady looking at the viewer" width="4096" height="2048" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/pensive-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/pensive-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/pensive-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/pensive-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/pensive-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/pensive-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>We've seen complete AI-written articles all across the internet. Sometimes we can tell the difference - especially in the tech tutorial space. Even at the biggest publishers, AI-written articles from freelancers, while explicitly forbidden, are tacitly allowed because the relentless production process doesn't encourage editors to pick up on what is clearly (to someone knowledgeable in the field ) machine-written drivel.</p>
<p>Humans bring something more to art and writing than can be produced by a chatbot, and no, we're not going to quote the famous dialogue from I, Robot.</p>
<p>It's hard to quantify or qualify exactly what that something is, but it's easy to find if you read quality independently published blogs on the internet: We'd suggest Ernie Smith's <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Tedium</a> to find it, or any other well-thought-out one-person publications. In the more mainstream space, you'll see it in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The New Yorker</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Markup</a>, and <a href="https://www.404media.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">404 media</a>.</p>
<p>It's excellent writing, and critical thinking from <em>people</em> who clearly know what they're talking about. AI doesn't investigate, nor does it ruminate or have an original thought. It's a probability engine recycling what it's previously been fed. Eventually, AI will end up eating its own shit, but that's a story for another day.</p>
<p>To a casual internet user, reader, or appreciator of art, it's not always obvious what is AI generated content and what is real, human, and authentic. If we're being honest, even before AI, a large proportion of what you read online was content-mill nonsense, but now, even those underpaid dollar-per-day spinners are out of a job.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/21/grant-shapps-accused-of-editing-wikipedia-pages-of-tory-rivals" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Alleged</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/08/grants-shapps-altered-wikipedia-entry" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia editor</a>, middle initial fabricator, fake name lover, and the UK's current Secretary of State for Defence (The Right Honourable Grant Shapps, Member of Parliament for Welwyn Hatfield) used to make his living via <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/02/grant-shapps-google-howtocorp-adsense" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">article-spinning software</a> - before presiding over an unrelated <a href="https://linuximpact.com/a-govuk-site-dedicated-to-porn-absolutely-best-of-british-porn-not-quite/">empire of filth</a>. By all reports, it was so shit that 19 of his companies were banned by Google (do you know how bad you have to be to end up blacklisted by big G?), so in all probability, AI will actually improve the readability of some web content. The best will always stand out, if you can find it.</p>
<p>But that's not the point.</p>
<h2 id="h-proclaim-and-reclaim-your-humanity">Proclaim (and reclaim ) your humanity</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/boaty.jpeg" alt="Output of stable diffusion for the prompt - Proclaim (and reclaim ) your humanity - featuring a silhouette of people dancing on a boat" width="4096" height="2048" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/boaty-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/boaty-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/boaty-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/boaty-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/boaty-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/boaty-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>For companies, it will always be desirable to reduce capital costs and maximise profitability. Sure, shovel shit for SEO a la Grant Schapps and countless others. But while it may have, historically, fooled search engines and maximised SEO, it was pretty fucking obvious to a genuine human person (or three dogs in a trenchcoat) that a trash page on a trash site was trash.</p>
<p>It's harder now - AI spews grammatically correct, well-structured, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-fluent-bs/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">plausible bullshit</a> and there needs to be a way of distinguishing the trash from considered, and curated content.</p>
<p>Looping back to the beginning of this article, there needs to be a badge that says that the writer is at least mostly human.</p>
<h2 id="h-where-did-the-badge-come-from-whats-the-point-and-does-it-actually-mean-anything">Where did the badge come from? What's the point? Does it actually mean anything?</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/badge.jpeg" alt="AI generated image for the prompt - Where did the badge come from? What's the point? Does it actually mean anything? - a large badge with the number 5 and garbled text on a maroon shirt" width="4096" height="2048" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/badge-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/badge-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/badge-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/badge-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/badge-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/badge-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Somewhere on this page you'll see a virtual badge that states, "Written by human <strong>not by AI</strong>". It proudly proclaims that this writer is human - which is something we've always suspected, but never been able to prove.</p>
<p>We can't prove it now, of course. The badge is a virtual artefact - and like the NFT madness of 2022, there's little to stop anybody, right-clicking it and sticking it on their website. The badge is an SVG file - go on, we dare you.</p>
<p>The fucking thing isn't even trademarked.</p>
<p>But the badge was created by a human, and that means that it's automatically copyrighted to Allen, the founder of <strong>Not By AI</strong>. There's a license attached, and there are <a href="https://notbyai.fyi/license" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">conditions for its use</a>.</p>
<p>Allen recognises that AI is here, and here to stay. He appreciates that AI is used for research*, and for purposes that are not central to the site on which the badge is displayed. That's probably why there are three versions of the badge.</p>
<p>In addition to the "Written by human" badge, you can also grab the "Painted by human" badge if your work is based around artwork, or "Produced by human" for anything else.</p>
<p>It doesn't even mean that your work has to be completely created by a human being - 90% is all Allen asks. That's pretty reasonable.</p>
<p>In fact, for us, that's great. While, the production of this article has involved no AI whatsoever, we do have a monthly <a href="https://linuximpact.com/tags/horoscope/">AI generated horoscope</a>, purportedly cast by a Psychic cat named "Mystic Mog". It's a low-effort gimmick, and one that we find hilarious. We don't think we're threatening the livelihoods of any genuine professional prognosticators with it. And it's under the 10% mark.</p>
<p>More questionable is our use of AI generated imagery. Again, this isn't particularly prevalent. We've gone overboard with it in this article (by feeding the H2s into an AI image generator) to make a point, but usually, we opt for royalty free images, or whatever we can knock up in GIMP. We use an offline version of Stable Diffusion to create entertaining(ish) images for dry-as-sandpaper topics such as installing <a href="https://linuximpact.com/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-docker-compose-on-linux-and-why-you-should/">Docker Compose</a>, or a tool to <a href="https://linuximpact.com/podman-tui-makes-managing-containers-a-breeze/">monitor Podman</a> deployments. There are only so many Unsplash licensed shipping container images out there, and what the hell does a Podman look like anyway?</p>
<p>That's why we have the "Written by human" badge - we don't have the "Painted by human", the or "Produced by human" badges. We can't claim that.</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with the <strong>Not by AI</strong> scheme knows pretty much what they're getting here. The articles are written by a human, some of the images may not be. Got it.</p>
<p>According to the license, Not by AI badges are free for non-commercial use, but cost $99 if you're a business.</p>
<p>Currently, Linux Impact makes exactly $0, although we hope that will change (check out our affiliate links and banners!). We emailed Allen, and he said we're fine. He'll be updating the license to better clarify what constitutes commercial or non-commercial usage.</p>
<h2 id="h-im-not-paying-for-that">I'm not paying for that!</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/nicechat.jpeg" alt="Ai generated image for the promt - I'm not paying for that! - two women talking, while a log fire burns on a bed behind them" width="4096" height="2048" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/nicechat-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/nicechat-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/nicechat-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/nicechat-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/nicechat-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/64/responsive/nicechat-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Good. We hope that's what most of the gigantic, shit-shovelling content mills will say - even as they incorporate more and more AI into their workflow.</p>
<p>The Schapps style operations though? They'll have no qualms about appropriating the badge if they think it will give them more credibility, more SEO juice, more clicks, or more authenticity.</p>
<p>We don't know where Allen's $99 goes. he could be spending it on blackjack, hookers, and rum-based cocktails for all we know.</p>
<p>It's more likely, however, that he supports himself financially while spending long days, checking where the image is used, auditing the content, and preparing a war chest to deal with entities that use his little SVG files where they shouldn't. It'll be cool.</p>
<p>But Not by AI stands a chance - not a huge chance - of improving the web as you use it today. The little badge at the top of the page means that someone, somewhere, has spent their Sunday afternoon wearing their fingers down by grudgingly typing out 1,980 words. It's considered, and they've thought about it. It's not just a tweaked prompt response, based on someone else's work.</p>
<p>That has to mean something, right?</p>
<p>Right?</p>

<p>If you've spent your hard earned cash supporting independent artists through Bandcamp, a series of ownership changes and layoffs suggest that now might be the best time for audiophiles to download their audio files to secure offline storage.</p>
<h2 id="h-whats-been-happening-at-bandcamp">What's been happening at Bandcamp?</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/babel.jpeg" alt="painting of a crumbling tower of Babel" width="4096" height="2048" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/babel-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/babel-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/babel-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/babel-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/babel-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/babel-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Bandcamp was set up in 2007 as an audio distribution platform where artists and their labels had complete control of sales, streams, and later, production and distribution and physical products.</p>
<p>Arriving at a time when Spotify was coming to dominate audio streaming, and Google's recent YouTube purchase sent shivers of discomfort down the spines of nascent musical stars, Bandcamp offered them control of their media in a way that other platforms couldn't.</p>
<p>In March 2022, Epic games (itself partially owned by Chinese tech behemoth and holding company, Tencent) acquired Bandcamp. The following year, after massively bigging up the business, they sold it to Songtradr - a competing music platform. With us so far?</p>
<p>Songtradr had acquired the business, but declined to acquire roughly half of the employees. Songtradr is also refusing to recognise the Bandcamp union, which was voted into existence in March 2023.</p>
<p>According to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Aftermath</a>, Bandcamp is a mess right now, with most of the support team gone. This leaves artists under the care of people who are either incredibly overworked, barely trained, or both. Engineers are doing work normally allotted to the support staff - normally a highly trained, competent, and enthusiastic crew.</p>
<h2 id="h-bandcamp-is-looking-a-little-shaky-right-now">When the music's over (Turn out the lights)</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/myspace.png" alt="myspace homepage with broken images" width="1910" height="955" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/myspace-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/myspace-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/myspace-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/myspace-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/myspace-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/myspace-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>With the support department looking less capable, artists will be looking to publish elsewhere, and with engineers taking up the support team's slack (BOOM), who's looking after the infrastructure that keeps the site running, the streams streaming, and your thousands of purchased albums safely on their virtual shelves?</p>
<p>Neglect can kill a company, and if it doesn't kill it, then it can leave it lurching on, even while its soul has been banished to the shadow realm.</p>
<p>Even if a company appears normal after a series of takeovers and disasters, its usefulness - its core offering and raison d'être - is gone or genericised.</p>
<p>Remember MySpace? You don't have to remember it, it's right there at <a href="https://myspace.com/">myspace.com</a>. Visit today, and you'll see band pages, you'll be able to stream music, watch videos, and 'connect with people'.</p>
<p>But MySpace is long dead, and what remains is a reanimated revenant resurrected yet again by corporate owners we can't even be bothered to research.</p>
<p>MySpace used to host the music of thousands of independent bands, at the same time it was the world's dominant social media platform. Most of that music is gone now - everything before 2015 disappeared during a fucked-up server migration in 2019, with only fragments available on the Internet Archive.</p>
<p>Want to run a massive, content-heavy service on a shoestring budget? That's the kind of thing that happens.</p>
<h2 id="h-run-dont-walk">There's an extension for that...</h2>
<p>While we're not saying that Bandcamp is going to disappear into nothing (MySpace is still around after all), we think it's perhaps prudent to download your albums from Bandcamp and store them offline. You never know - that's all we're saying.</p>
<p>The Bandcamp UI isn't really designed with massive downloads in mind, and there are a lot of boxes to tick.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it's pretty easy to download all of your Bandcamp music using the excellent Batchcamp extension which is available as both a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/batchcamp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FireFox addon</a>, or as a <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Google Chrome extension</a>.</p>
<p>Install the extension/add-on in the usual way, and pin it to your browser.</p>
<p>When you're logged into Bandcamp through the website, click the Batchcamp icon, and select your preferred audio format from the dropdown. You have a choice of <strong>MP3 V0</strong>, <strong>MP3 320</strong>, <strong>FLAC</strong>, <strong>AAC</strong>, <strong>Ogg Vorbis</strong>, <strong>ALAC</strong>, <strong>WAV</strong>, or <strong>AIFF</strong>.</p>
<p>While you can set Batchcamp to download up to eight concurrent downloads, we'd suggest that three is reasonable - you don't want to stress a potentially delicate structure.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/collection.png" alt="bandcamp collection with batchcamp purple button" width="1915" height="957" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/collection-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/collection-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/collection-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/collection-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/collection-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/63/responsive/collection-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>At the bottom of the page, you'll see a purple(ish) <strong>Select All</strong> button. Hit it, then <strong>Download</strong>. Depending on how many albums you have i your collection this may take a while.</p>
<p>We suggest that you do this twice. Once in your preferred listening format, and once in the the highest lossless quality there is. You can convert this to future formats when they arrive on the scene in the future.</p>
<h2 id="h-stream-you-own-tracks">Stream your own tracks on your own network</h2>
<p>The ability to stream audio tracks is great, but its even better when its streaming from your own hardware on your own network.</p>
<p><a href="https://linuximpact.com/paranoid-and-perplexed-by-plex-privacy-pickle-just-enjoy-jellyfin/">Jellyfin</a> is an open-source project that will help you organise, store, and stream music, shows, and movies from your own server. It will run on pretty much anything you have around from an old laptop, to a Raspberry Pi, to a dedicated high spec server.</p>

                <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">MacOS is weird. It's kind of like Linux, but also not. It's based on the open-source Darwin OS, but everything that makes the OS usable in the 21st century is proprietary. It has a recognisable and usable terminal, but you can't use it to access all parts of the OS and tweak the innards to how you want them. You don't have control.</p>
<p>Every now and then, however, it becomes necessary to run some piece of macOS software that's not available on Linux. There's no Final Cut Pro for Linux, nor any GarageBand - so creating professional level singles and the associated MTV-style music videos isn't an option.</p>
<h2 id="h-running-macos-software-can-be-a-bitch-if-you-dont-have-a-mac">Running MacOS software can be a bitch if you don't have a Mac</h2>
<p>If you have a desperate need to run some MacOS only software, your options are limited, and we've laid them out for you below:</p>
<h3 id="h-buy-a-mac">Buy a Mac</h3>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MacOS software will run as it should, on the hardware it was designed for.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Macs are expensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The clean aesthetic doesn't suit your tinkerer lifestyle, or the rest of your home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's a Mac.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don't actually want to own a Mac.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h-build-a-hackintosh">Build a Hackintosh</h3>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Considerably cheaper than a Mac</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be as ugly or weird as you like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building a Hackintosh and getting it working will keep you busy for days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While cheaper than a genuine Apple product, it's still not cheap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet another computer in the house</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building a Hackintosh and getting it working will keep you busy for days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h-run-macos-in-virtualbox">Run MacOS in VirtualBox</h2>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Free!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fairly difficult and involved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We should note at this point that MacOS is only licensed to be run on approved and genuine Apple hardware.</p>
<h2 id="h-the-easiest-way-to-run-macos-on-your-linux-system">The easiest way to run MacOS on your Linux system</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/blurryface.png" alt="A face stencilled in black on a yellow paving slab leaning against a brick wall" width="2000" height="1000" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/blurryface-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/blurryface-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/blurryface-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/blurryface-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/blurryface-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/blurryface-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Fortunately for you there's another way to run MacOS software on your Linux PC, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX">Docker-OSX</a> - a GPL3-licensed open-source project from Sick Codes dedicated to getting proprietary Apple code working on your Linux machine as quickly and smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>Docker-OSX relies on a KVM virtualisation built atop KVM-OpenCore, and unlike a virtual machine that you have to set up and configure yourself, is containerised with Docker (it's in the name).</p>
<p>What this means is everything is preconfigured and ready to go. You don't need to worry - it will just work.</p>
<p>The project has an impressive array of macOS versions on offer, so if you need a particular software version tied to a specific OS version, or just like the aesthetics, you can choose from (in no particular order) High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, or Ventura.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that the project also uses <a href="https://github.com/sickcodes/osx-serial-generator">OSX Serial Generator</a> - another project from Sick Codes - that generates valid OSX serial numbers, allowing you use to iMessage on your virtual Mac.</p>
<h2 id="h-get-a-virtual-mac-on-linux-in-minutes">Get a virtual mac on Linux in minutes</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/pastelmac.png" alt="An imac in a pastel lit room" width="2000" height="1000" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/pastelmac-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/pastelmac-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/pastelmac-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/pastelmac-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/pastelmac-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/pastelmac-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Well, minutes might be a tiny bit misleading unless you have an insanely fast internet connection and the stars are aligned in a certain way. We actually managed to have a fully useable desktop in about half an hour. Your mileage may vary according to your provider, and the specs of your machine.</p>
<p>Before you start, make sure you have <a href="https://linuximpact.com/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-docker-compose-on-linux-and-why-you-should/">Docker and Docker Compose</a> installed. In theory, Docker-OSX ought to work with <a href="https://linuximpact.com/podman-tui-makes-managing-containers-a-breeze/">Podman</a>, too - although we haven't tried this.</p>
<p>You'll also need some additional dependencies. Grab them with the commands below:</p>
<p>On Debian-based systems:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install qemu qemu-kvm libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-system bridge-utils virt-manager libguestfs-tools</code></pre>
<p>For the Fedora family:</p>
<pre><code>sudo yum install libvirt qemu-kvm</code></pre>
<p>Arch and co:</p>
<pre><code>sudo pacman -S qemu libvirt dnsmasq virt-manager bridge-utils flex bison iptables-nft edk2-ovmf</code></pre>
<p>To try out Docker-OSX, we used the Catalina image.</p>
<pre><code>docker run -it \
    --device /dev/kvm \
    -p 50922:10022 \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -e "DISPLAY=${DISPLAY:-:0.0}" \
    sickcodes/docker-osx:latest</code></pre>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/macos_utilities_menu.png" alt="standard macos utilities menu" width="1337" height="579" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/macos_utilities_menu-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/macos_utilities_menu-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/macos_utilities_menu-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/macos_utilities_menu-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/macos_utilities_menu-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/62/responsive/macos_utilities_menu-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>At a mere 1.7GB, it took less than eight minutes until we were looking at an icon of a hard drive. You can press this or wait 30 seconds for setup to continue. Another minute and you'll be on the macOS utilities menu. Click on <strong>DIsk Utility</strong>, and find the the disk with the highest capacity. Click <strong>Erase</strong>, then give a name to the disk that will take its place. "Mydisk" is good if you're searching for inspiration. Leave the <strong>Format</strong> and <strong>Scheme</strong> with their default values. Click <strong>Erase</strong> when you're happy, then the big blue <strong>Done</strong> button when it's done. When you return to the <strong>Disk Utility</strong> menu, you should see your new disk name listed on the left.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, leave the Disk Utility, and then press on <strong>Reinstall macOS</strong>. Go through the prompts, and you're done. Welcome to the macOS life!</p>
<p>For Big Sur, the command is:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -it \
    --device /dev/kvm \
    -p 50922:10022 \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -e "DISPLAY=${DISPLAY:-:0.0}" \
    sickcodes/docker-osx:big-sur</code></pre>
<p>For Monterey:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -it \
    --device /dev/kvm \
    -p 50922:10022 \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -e "DISPLAY=${DISPLAY:-:0.0}" \
    -e GENERATE_UNIQUE=true \
    -e MASTER_PLIST_URL='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sickcodes/osx-serial-generator/master/config-custom.plist' \
    sickcodes/docker-osx:monterey</code></pre>
<p>...and for Ventura:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -it \
    --device /dev/kvm \
    -p 50922:10022 \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -e "DISPLAY=${DISPLAY:-:0.0}" \
    -e GENERATE_UNIQUE=true \
    -e MASTER_PLIST_URL='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sickcodes/osx-serial-generator/master/config-custom.plist' \
    sickcodes/docker-osx:ventura</code></pre>
<p>But who can be bothered going through the macOSX setup process? It's dull, and you have better things to do with your time.</p>
<p>If you want to swerve the chore of clicking through screens, theeasiest way to get your Virtual Mac up and running is to use the pre-installed Catalina image. It's completely hands-off, but it isn't the quickest. The Download itself is in excess of 20GB, and you'll need at least 40GB free on your host machine.</p>
<p>If you want to go with this option, pop open a terminal, and enter:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -it \
    --device /dev/kvm \
    -p 50922:10022 \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -e "DISPLAY=${DISPLAY:-:0.0}" \
    -e GENERATE_UNIQUE=true \
    sickcodes/docker-osx:auto</code></pre>
<p>Take the dogs for a walk, <a href="#non-existing-post-with-id-60">browse the web without encountering paywalls</a>, spin up an <a href="https://linuximpact.com/set-up-your-own-xmpp-server-on-a-raspberry-pi-in-under-five-minutes/">XMPP server</a>, or l<a href="https://linuximpact.com/self-host-your-own-audio-library-with-audiobookshelf/">isten to an audiobook</a>. This will take a bit.</p>
<p>When it's done, you'll be on the login screen of a brand new Catalina install. The username is <strong>user</strong>, and the password is <strong>alpine</strong>.</p>
<p>The preinstalled image is cool and super-easy, and we'd suggest using this one if you genuinely have better things to be getting on with.</p>

<p>Sick Codes can use and distribute proprietary Apple software because he's a security researcher doing security researcher things. We're not 100 percent sure how that works, but we're taking it at face value.</p>
<p>In the project documentation, you'll see numerous references to it being used for security research, and there are terms and conditions attached to Docker-OSX.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By using this Dockerfile, you hereby <strong>agree that you are a security reseacher or developer</strong> and agree to use this Dockerfile to make the world a safer place.

</blockquote>
<p>We're pretty sure that Apple isn't going to check your security credentials or sue you for using their god-awful browser instead of making the world a safer place, but we couldn't say for sure.</p>

                <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Podman is the new kid on the container orchestration block. While on the surface it looks and behaves like better-established container tools like <a href="https://linuximpact.com/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-docker-compose-on-linux-and-why-you-should/">Docker</a>, under the hood, it has some radical improvements to security.</p>
<p>But managing your Pods can be a chore. Podman TUI gives you handy, at-a-glance summary and control over all your Podman applications.</p>
<h2 id="h-why-use-podman-in-the-first-place">Why use Podman in the first place?</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61/podman-underwater.jpeg" alt="A cartoonish submarine with eyes next to a shipping container underwater" width="4096" height="2048" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61/responsive/podman-underwater-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61/responsive/podman-underwater-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61/responsive/podman-underwater-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61/responsive/podman-underwater-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61/responsive/podman-underwater-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61/responsive/podman-underwater-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Containerisation is good for developers and good for users. Instead of creating and shipping a package which relies on dependencies which may or may not be on the user's system, and may or may not be a compatible version, devs can shovel into a container everything their apps need to run, and send it off on the software seas to its eventual home.</p>
<p>For the devs, this means they don't need to test the project in a huge and varied range of distros, versions, and custom tweaks the end-user might be running. Just one.</p>
<p>Will the user be running Arch, Debian, BSD? Who cares? Ship Alpine as a base image and it'll be fine.</p>
<p>For the user, it means there's no chance of falling into the depths and confusion of dependency hell as you chase your own tail around what package versions you have installed, what you need, and trying to remember why exactly you have <strong>libpng_1.2.54</strong> pinned on your system when its actually older than your teenage kids.</p>
<p>Other containerisation options exist, but Podman is arguably superior from a security point of view because it runs without a root daemon - meaning that those teenage kids can install software without endangering the rest of your system. Plus, if your pod does turn out to be loaded with superpowered parasite and worm laden produce, it's not going to spread to the rest of your machine or network.</p>
<h2 id="h-managing-pods-can-be-a-pita">Managing pods can be a PITA</h2>
<p>OK. It's not that bad. Podman comes with an almost identical set of commands to Docker. You can run pods with:</p>
<pre><code>podman run</code></pre>
<p>view your running containers with:</p>
<pre><code>podman ps</code></pre>
<p>Or check the logs with:</p>
<pre><code>podman logs</code></pre>
<p>You can kill, crush, and destroy, in a similar way. Start, stop, whatever.</p>
<p>But it's all kind of piecemeal. In one way, that's good. After all, a tool should do one thing and do it well, but there are times when you'd just like to be able to navigate your Podman pods quickly, and in one place.</p>
<h2 id="h-podman-tui-is-a-tui-for-podman">Podman-tui is a TUI for Podman</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61//podman-tui-log.png" alt="log for mealie in Podman-tui." width="1902" height="911" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61//responsive/podman-tui-log-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61//responsive/podman-tui-log-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61//responsive/podman-tui-log-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61//responsive/podman-tui-log-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61//responsive/podman-tui-log-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61//responsive/podman-tui-log-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Something of a redundant tautology in the title up there, and we apologise for it.</p>
<p>Podman-tui is the answer to the question, "how can I manage my pods, monitor them, check pod health, and put them out of their misery without typing in a bunch of commands", but that was too wordy for a subheading.</p>
<p>If you're foresighted enough to run CentOS Stream, Fedora, Gentoo, RHEL, or Arch Linux with AUR, you can install Podman-tui from your distro repositories. The package name is <strong>podman-tui</strong>, and you know how to do the rest.</p>
<p>Everyone else will have to compile from source. Instructions are provided in the repository, and make sure you have <strong>Golang</strong> installed before you start.</p>
<p>Once you have Podman-tui installed on your system, starting it is as simple as entering:</p>
<pre><code>podman-tui</code></pre>
<p>...into your terminal</p>
<p>The default view is <strong>System Connections</strong>, which on our setup isn't that interesting. Hit <strong>F3</strong> to get an overview of your pods, together with their ID, status, creation time, and number of attached containers.</p>
<p><strong>F4</strong> will get you the containers, <strong>F5</strong> the volumes, <strong>F6</strong> the images, and <strong>F7</strong> is for Networks. So far, so straightforward.</p>
<p>From any of these views you can use your keyboard to highlight any pod, container, image, etc. Hitting <strong>M</strong> brings up a menu of things you can do with them.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61//podman-tui-menu-2.png" alt="Available actions menu in Podman-tui.  The logs entry is highlighted" width="1901" height="916" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61//responsive/podman-tui-menu-2-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61//responsive/podman-tui-menu-2-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61//responsive/podman-tui-menu-2-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61//responsive/podman-tui-menu-2-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61//responsive/podman-tui-menu-2-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/61//responsive/podman-tui-menu-2-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>In the above screenshot, you can see 20 different actions it's possible to take on our selected Uptime-Kuma container. These range from simple troubleshooting options such as a healthcheck or viewing the logs, to creating checkpoints and committing changes.</p>
<p>It's everything you need, all in one place.</p>
<p>We're only running two containers on our virtual machine (Mealie and Uptime-Kuma), and we're already finding it pretty useful , but if you're orchestrating dozens of pods, Podman-tui could prove itself invaluable.</p>
<h2 id="h-use-podman-tui-to-manage-all-your-containerised-apps">Use Podman-tui to manage all your containerised apps</h2>
<p>As the dominant player in the containerisation game, you'll find many apps packed up and ready to go with Docker. But because both Docker and Podman adhere and contribute to the <a href="https://opencontainers.org/">Open Container Initiative</a>, anything that works with Docker <em>should</em> work with Podman, too.</p>
<p>Consider switching your containerised apps over to Podman. Some of our favourites are <a href="https://linuximpact.com/freshrss-stay-safe-and-never-visit-another-website-again/">FreshRSS</a>, <a href="https://linuximpact.com/self-host-your-own-audio-library-with-audiobookshelf/">AudioBookshelf</a>, <a href="https://linuximpact.com/set-up-your-own-xmpp-server-on-a-raspberry-pi-in-under-five-minutes/">Snikket</a>, and <a href="https://linuximpact.com/immich-is-the-killer-app-that-will-kick-start-the-self-hosting-revolution/">Immich</a>.</p>

A few seconds later, usually just as you've almost made it to the end of the first sentence of the second paragraph, the text blurs, and a pop-up appears in the centre of your vision:</p>

<p>Yes, you've hit the soft paywall, and now your day is ruined. You'll have to stop randomly cruising from article to article or exploring a website's deep archives, and do some actual work instead.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's an easy way to quickly bypass most soft paywalls.</p>
<h2 id="h-why-do-paywalls-exist">Why do paywalls exist?</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/orange-wall-2.png" alt="A person walking past an orange wall with an accessible door a few weeks above ground. The words Keep Out are sprayed above the door" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/orange-wall-2-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/orange-wall-2-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/orange-wall-2-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/orange-wall-2-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/orange-wall-2-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/orange-wall-2-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>A paywall is a barrier you're not supposed to get past unless you pay - it's in the name.</p>
<p>The ad-funded model of financing websites isn't ideal. Readers don't like adverts, and they like being tracked around the web even less. It's not great for publishers either - they need huge amounts of traffic, and associated ad clicks to make producing content worthwhile.</p>
<p>One solution is for publishers to erect a hard paywall. This means that if you want to read <em>any </em>articles on a website, you have to have a subscription and log into the site. Nothing and no-one can get past without a subscription. There are some sites that require you to create a 'free' account to make it easier to target and track your usage.</p>
<p>There are a few websites that operate this way. <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Times</a> is notably one hard holdout. While publishers using hard paywalls often have a more reliable revenue stream, there are disadvantages to operating a completely solid paywall. Search engines can't access your content, which means that your SEO is shot.</p>
<p>Soft paywalls operate differently, and whether or not, and how they allow you to view content depends on factors such as how many articles you've viewed this month, whether you're a bot, the source of your click, and other such metrics.</p>
<p>Click through from the wrong source, have the wrong user agent string, or read too many gift articles? Tough shit. It's time to buy a raft of subscriptions. Unless, of course, the articles are so-called 'buyers guides', lists of tech you can buy, best-of reviews, or other such crappy content designed to shift stock through affiliate links. In this case, you can probably read as much as you want.</p>
<p>The kind of paywall that shows up if your browser is using an adblock, is especially disliked.</p>
<h2 id="h-there-are-workarounds-for-soft-paywalls">There are workarounds for soft paywalls</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/scooterman.png" alt="Someone driving past a brick wall on a scooter" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/scooterman-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>As soft paywalls usually kick in based on who you are, where you've come from, and what you've already read, you can fake fake some of these factors.</p>
<p>If you want to read a Financial Times article, for instance, you'll need to set your browser user agent to spoof as googlebot - or just go and read Google's cached version.</p>
<p>For other sites, you have to stop assets being loaded from certain domains or subdomains.</p>
<p>Of course, the simplest soft paywall relies on cookies, so it's a simple thing to right-click on links, and open them in spanky new private windows, and close the window when you're done. Some sites will even let you in if you preface the URL with "<strong>https://facebook.com/l.php?u</strong>=".</p>
<p>There are other hacks, and we even have a spreadsheet somewhere with a list.</p>
<p>But it's a chore. Yes, you want to read the articles; no, you don't want to take out another subscription while randomly link-surfing; no, you don't want to have to dig out your long list of paywall exploits.</p>
<p>For a long time, we used to browse the web with Lynx and images be damned, but that's become less consistently effective as paywall enforcement methods have changed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's a paywall-dodging extension that takes the hard work out of reading content for free.</p>
<h2 id="h-bypass-paywalls-clean-does-exactly-what-you-think-it-does">Bypass Paywalls Clean does exactly what you think it does</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/hammer.png" alt="A hammer being held in a dirty gloved hand" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/hammer-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/hammer-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/hammer-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/hammer-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/hammer-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/hammer-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Bypass Paywalls Clean is an extension. Actually it's a couple of extensions: <a href="https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-firefox-clean" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Bypass Paywalls Firefox Clean</a>, (which is for FireFox),and <a href="https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Bypass Paywalls Chrome Clean</a>, which works on Chrome-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, and Yandex.</p>
<p>It's an ever evolving project, which is constantly updating to add new methods of outwitting paywalls, as well as growing the collection of sites with which it works.</p>
<p>As an extension, BPC sits between you and the site you're visiting. It rewrites the traffic as it passes through.</p>
<p>For some websites, it might allow in a single cookie then delete it as you cruise around indulging your curiosity; for others, it might change your user agent string. Sometimes, BPC will simply block the pop-up, and at different times and in different places, it will need to block APIs.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/bpc-repository.png" alt="Some code in the block paywalls firefox clean repository" width="1914" height="891" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/bpc-repository-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/bpc-repository-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/bpc-repository-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/bpc-repository-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/bpc-repository-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/59/responsive/bpc-repository-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>The point is that, yes, you could do all of this by hand, but with BPC, everything is in one place, so you won't have to.</p>
<p>After half an hour you won't even think about it. We installed Bypass Paywalls Clean before lunch today - just to test it out, and went to check out some previously paywalled sites. It just works. Full content, normal layout, and no need to fiddle with things, or close our normal browser (for websites with a free article limit, just click the BPC extension button then clear cookies. It's no biggie).</p>
<p>This is a whole new internet experience, and we've learned some new paywall-avoidance tricks just by using it, and checking out the code. We've even incorporated some into our <a href="https://linuximpact.com/freshrss-stay-safe-and-never-visit-another-website-again/">fabulous FreshRSS instance</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h-does-bpc-unblock-every-paywalled-article-and-site">Does BPC unblock every paywalled article and site?</h2>
<p>If you're familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridges_law_of_headlines">Betteridge's Law</a>, you already know the answer to that question. No, it doesn't.</p>
<p>While you can use BPC to bypass hundreds of paywalls on the most popular sites, it doesn't yet cover everything. More sites are being added all the time, though, so your preferred reading material <em>may</em> be available some day. If you want to speed that day along, you can <a href="https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-firefox-clean/-/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">submit a request to have a site added</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can add your own sites and rules to Block Paywalls Clear through the settings menu.</p>
<p>Hard paywalled sites can't be bypassed either, so if you're desperate to read the latest from The Times, head to one of the archive sites instead. </p>
<p>Sometimes soft-paywall websites will have certain hard-paywalled articles. BPC won't help with these either.</p>
<h2 id="h-is-bypass-paywalls-clean-safe-to-use">Is Bypass Paywalls Clean safe to use?</h2>

<p>Extensions can read all of the traffic that goes through your browser, so in theory, no extension can be guaranteed as safe under all circumstances. This is one of the reasons Google gives for degrading the capabilities of Chrome extensions.</p>
<p>BPC is ethically developed, and open-source - but there's no guarantee that the maintainers won't slip in some kind of malware in future, or the project won't be taken over by an evil villain intent of poisoning your machine and stealing your data</p>
<p>These aren't trivial concern, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">it does happen to open-source projects</a>. Extensions have also been used as trojans, viruses, keyloggers, and other such horrible things.</p>
<p>It's a very small risk, and no greater than that of any other browser extension, but it's one that you should take into consideration.</p>
<p>That Bypass Paywalls Clean isn't present in either the Mozilla add-ons store or the Google Chrome Web Store could be indicative, but we're fairly sure it's a business decision by Mozilla and Google rather than anything else.

                <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Everyone responds differently to sounds. For some people, the rhythmic chugging of a train as it travels between cities might act as a soporific. In other people, it could induce an adrenline rush of productivity - calling to mind frantic typing on the last leg of the commuter run when you should have done the work last night instead of indulging in boozy karaoke.</p>
<p>Your own aural triggers to productivity and sleep are probably different. Maybe you work best in a noisy coffee shop when it's raining outside, or can only sleep soundly next to a roaring campfire, deep in the rainforest.</p>

<p>Blanket is an open-source app for Linux that you can use to create a layered, multi-textural sonic smorgasbord to help you get in the mood for whatever it is you need to do.</p>
<p>And we can only assume that self-identified Peruvian anarchist, web dev, open- source enthusiast, and farmer, <a href="https://github.com/rafaelmardojai" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Rafael Mardojai</a>, is too busy with his many projects to get any proper sleep without assistance.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/58/effects.png" alt="" width="1920" height="718" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/58/responsive/effects-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/58/responsive/effects-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/58/responsive/effects-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/58/responsive/effects-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/58/responsive/effects-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/58/responsive/effects-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Blanket is packaged as an attractive GNOME app, and comes stocked with seven nature sounds, three interiors, white noise, pink noise, and the ability to add your own custom sounds. The volume of each sound is adjustable by slider - meaning you can easily level each layer to get your perfect ambient audio landscape.</p>
<h2 id="h-install-blanket-on-linux">Install Blanket on Linux</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get Blanket on Linux is with FlatPak. If you have FlatPak installed on your system and linked to FlatHub, pop open a terminal and enter:</p>
<pre><code>flatpak install flathub com.rafaelmardojai.Blanket </code></pre>
<p>Installation should take a couple of minutes at most (under 20 MB will be downloaded), and once its complete, you can start Blanket from your system menu or enter:</p>
<pre><code>flatpak run com.rafaelmardojai.Blanket</code></pre>
<p>...into a terminal. It's a lengthy command, so you may want to consider an alias.</p>
<pre><code>echo -e "\nalias blanket='flatpak run com.rafaelmardojai.Blanket'" &gt;&gt; .bashrc</code></pre>
<h2 id="h-use-blanket-to-make-your-perfect-ambient-soundscape">Use Blanket to make your perfect ambient soundscape</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/58/tyres.png" alt="closeup image from ground level of the front of a car and one tyre in heavy rain at night" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/58/responsive/tyres-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/58/responsive/tyres-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/58/responsive/tyres-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/58/responsive/tyres-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/58/responsive/tyres-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/58/responsive/tyres-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>You can almost recreate the intro from the Doors 1971 classic, Riders on the Storm with Blanket. There's the driving rain, tyres in wet, the distant crash of thunder - all you need is Robby Krieger's relentless guitar, John Densmore's delicate cymbal work, and the smooth pipework of Ray Manzarek's keyboard to nail the vibe.</p>
<p>We love the song, but we especially love the intro - for us, it's the perfect soundtrack as passengers on long car journeys in the dark. While we can properly engage with Morrison's vocals and lyrics on other occasions, the intro could probably knock us into the land of Nod in under five minutes. The problem is that it's only 45 seconds long.</p>
<p>We set out to create an enteral <em>Riders</em> intro.</p>
<p>It's not exact, but its close enough for our purposes.</p>
<p>We used <strong>yt-dlp</strong> to download <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/post/null" rel="nofollow">this 2012 video</a> of Ray Manzarek noodling with his mighty organ at home (snigger), and converted the audio to MP3. We extracted the 6:55 - 8:01(ish) section using Audacity, and exported it as an MP3.</p>
<p>Back in Blanket, we added the file as a <strong>custom sound</strong>, layered on some rain, and storm, and let rip. It's awesome, and we can listen to it for hours (except we can't because we'd fall asleep).</p>
<p>We decided against the guitar and cymbals, but may tinker around some more tonight.</p>
<p>That's what floats our boat, but its different strokes for different folks.</p>
<p>You may find you work or sleep better with using the inbuilt honking horns of a city centre and birdsong on a summer night or with the creak of a ship's rigging, and the slap of waves against the hull (This also slaps when overlaid with Manzarek's fingerwork).</p>
<p>Whether you go with the presets, or import your own (or more accurately, someone else's) sounds from elsewhere, Blanket makes it trivial to adjust the levels, and create an ambient layer that blends into the background with hypnotic effect.</p>

<h2 id="h-making-websites-is-fun">Making websites is fun!</h2>
<p>Humans need hobbies. We get bored easily, and need to do things to scratch that itch. Sure, you could go for a run, or engage in some sort of sport. But it's too cold outside (or maybe too hot, or to wet). Play a computer game? Scroll through TikTok or the 'gram? Watch TV?</p>
<p>Sure. These are some OK ways to pass the time, and they'll stave off the inevitable ennui that comes with having nothing to do.</p>
<p>You could read, sure, but isn't it better to write?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Shitposting</span> Engaging in discourse on Facebook / Reddit / The Fediverse / X is a waste of time. Once you spit your words into the character-limited text box, they're not yours anymore. And they'll vanish when your account is deleted, else be disappeared into the depths of 'the algorithm' never to surface again.</p>
<p>If you create your own website, you can write whatever you want without limits (bar legal ones). You're not restricted with an arbitrary wordcount, or a set layout, or topic or anything else.</p>
<p>You can post pictures, write about your day, your hobby, advertise your business, talk about cats, or religion, or politics. And when you've finished you can share it to your social media friends and followers and be proud of what you've done.</p>
<p>And it doesn't have to be difficult. You can easily create a website from scratch for free.</p>
<h2 id="h-static-sites-are-lighter-faster-and-in-most-cases-better">Static sites are lighter, faster, and (in most cases) better</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/front-page.png" alt="Front page of Linux Impact" width="1905" height="948" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/front-page-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/front-page-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/front-page-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/front-page-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/front-page-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/front-page-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>The majority of the sites you visit on the internet are created and managed using a web-based Content Management System (CMS) such as WordPress. A CMS is actually made up up of two parts: a content management application, into which you log in, create posts and organise your articles, and a content delivery application that converts your content into a web page that visitors can see. </p>
<p>Web-based CMSes are great, but they come with a significant overhead, and your site may struggle under heavy loads. An unless you host your site on your own server, you'll have to pay for hosting.</p>
<p>Static sites are a collection of web pages. A web browser requests a particular page, and the server sends an HTML document back. Thery're insanely fast, there's very little behind-the-scenes work, and you can get no-strings-attached hosting for free.</p>
<p><a href="https://linuximpact.com">Linux Impact</a> is a static site.</p>
<p>There was a time when to create pages for a website, you needed to be able to understand and Use HTML. That time is long gone, and you don't ever need to be able to use a code-editor in order to create a fabulous-looking, attractive website quickly.</p>
<p>Static Site Generators (SSGs) act as an offline content management app, and convert your words and images to HTML files that you can push to any server.</p>
<p>One final advantage to having a static site rather than an online CMS is security. If someone can log into your CMS admin panel with a cracked or stolen password, or exploit a security flaw in a plugin, it's game over. With static pages, there's nothing to log into. It's safer and more secure. </p>
<p>We've tried dozens over the years and can say with absolute certainty that none of them offer the same ease-of-use, friendly interface, and customisation options as Publii. </p>
<h2 id="h-get-publii">Get Publii!</h2>
<p>Publii is packaged as a binary (executable file), and is available from <a href="https://getpublii.com/">getpublii.com</a>. Download and install it according to the instructions on the site.</p>
<p>Open Publii for the first time, and you'll be guided through the process of making a website. You'll pick an avatar, and a name for your website.</p>
<p>After that, it's worthwhile creating a few test posts to see how everything works. It's best if already have some posts ready-to-go, but if not, some Lorum Ipsum text and royalty free images will do. Or hey, you could actually focus on writing instead of messing round with configuration and looks.</p>
<h3 id="h-create-your-first-publii-posts">Create your first Publii posts</h3>
<p>Create a post for the first time, and you have a choice of what kind of editor you want to use. If you're coming from WordPress, or have experience with that CMS, the block editor is probably your best choice. Alternatively, the WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor will give you an experience similar to that of a traditional word processor, with formatting options laid out along the top. The Markdown editor uses (unsurprisingly) Markdown, which is a lighweight language you can use to add formatting to text documents. If you're interested in Markdown, check out <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">markdownguide.org</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you already have your content published on a WordPress site, and are swapping to Publii because of the massive performance boost that comes with a static site, go to <strong>Tools &amp; Plugins &gt; WP Importer</strong> to start automatically importing your content, images, authors, and tags.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/publii-wysiwyg-editor.png" alt="The text of this article being edited in the Publii WYSIWYG editor" width="1919" height="1050" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/publii-wysiwyg-editor-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/publii-wysiwyg-editor-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/publii-wysiwyg-editor-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/publii-wysiwyg-editor-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/publii-wysiwyg-editor-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/publii-wysiwyg-editor-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>In all three editors, you'll have access to a collapsible menu on the right side of the screen. In here, you'll find some supremely useful options. In the top section, you can configure the post author, and attributes including whether the article is classed as featured, whether to exclude it from your homepage, or even hide it completely.</p>
<p>Below this, you can set the featured image, together with alt text for visually impaired readers, captions, and credits.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tags</strong> section is important. These are the categories in which an article will appear on your site. It governs what shows up as a related article, and forms the basis of the menu structure.</p>
<p>In the SEO section you can tune your site to be more (or less) friendly for search engines. In <strong>Post Slug</strong>, you can customise your URL, change the itle, and meta description, and choose whether you want search engines to index the page.</p>
<p>Lastly, there's the <strong>other options</strong>, there are too many to cover here, but they allow you to tweak the way your post appears, and make it different from other posts on the site. Nothing major - options to show the date, author, tags and so on.</p>
<p>Return to the <strong>Posts</strong> menu, and preview your changes. Publii will open a local copy of your site in the default browser.</p>
<h2 id="h-make-your-publii-website-pretty">Make your Publii website pretty</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/marketplace.png" alt="themes in the Publii marketplace" width="1912" height="957" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/marketplace-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/marketplace-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/marketplace-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/marketplace-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/marketplace-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/marketplace-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>By default, you'll only have the <strong>Simple</strong> theme installed. It's pretty good, and will render a classic list of posts with excerpts for your front page, along with a very nice layout for the articles themselves.</p>
<p>To truly customise your site, head over to the <a href="https://marketplace.getpublii.com/themes/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Publii marketplace</a>. There isn't a huge quantity of themes (27 at the time of writing), but are all high quality, with examples suitable for everything from image galleries and basic blogs to feature heavy documentation sites and magazines. Around a third of the themes are completely free, with the rest priced at around $30. You'll have to download your theme manually, and upload and select it through the Publii interface. Don't worry though, the excellent documentation makes it a breeze.</p>
<p>We considered the excellent <a href="https://marketplace.getpublii.com/themes/editorial-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Editorial</a> theme, but eventually settled on the fantastic looking, free, and functional <a href="https://marketplace.getpublii.com/themes/technews/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Technews</a> you're looking at now.</p>
<h2 id="h-whats-on-the-menu">What's on the menu?</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/settings.png" alt="Theme settings for Publii" width="1920" height="1047" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/settings-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/settings-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/settings-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/settings-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/settings-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/settings-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>In the <strong>Theme</strong> menu (accessible the the nav bar on the left), you can further refine your spanky new theme to look and behave exactly how you want it to. <strong>Basic settings</strong> include pagination, excerpt length, and site logo, while the fun stuff is slightly further down in <strong>Custom settings</strong>.</p>
<p>Customising WordPress themes can be a bitch unless you invest some serious time into learning CSS - and who has time for that?</p>
<p>In contrast, customising a Publii theme is simplicity itself: there are sliders, you can type in values for column width, or select layout options from a dropdown.</p>
<p>Want expandable submenus on mobile? toggle the radio button. Fed up with the colour scheme? Choose some new hues with the colour-picker. Corners too rounded or too sharp? adjust the slider. Easy-peasy. Want Social share buttons or a search box? This is where you'll find them.</p>
<p>Navigation is key to making any website usable, and the tags you create when making a post form the basis of Publii's menu system. The primary tag (you can select this with a dropdown) is displayed on the posts page and front page of the site, but secondary tags are important, too.</p>
<p>Take for instance, our article on setting up your own XMPP server on a Raspberry Pi in under five minutes. The primary tag is self-hosted, and but it's also tagged as DIY, Internet, Linux, Privacy, Raspberry Pi, Software, and Tips. These tags influence the <strong>Related</strong> <strong>posts</strong>, you see at the bottom of the page. More importantly they mean that if a menu item is linked to that tag, the post will appear in that section of the site.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/menus.png" alt="Adding a new menu item in Publii" width="1917" height="1038" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/menus-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/menus-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/menus-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/menus-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/menus-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/57/responsive/menus-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p><strong>Menus</strong> has its own item on the navigation sidebar. Click <strong>Add New Menu</strong>, and give it a name, then <strong>Add new menu item</strong>. You can add menu links to individual posts, such as an <strong>about</strong> page; to a <strong>tag link</strong> (this is how we do our category menus); to author pages; the front page; external links; internals; whatever. Simple eh?</p>
<h2 id="h-publish-your-website-with-publii">Publish your website with Publii</h2>
<p>You can spend hours customising your theme, and tweaking it to be exactly how you want it to be, but you'll be better off putting that time into writing.</p>
<p>When you're happy with the way your site looks, and have some quality content to give to the world, it's time to publish.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Before you can do this, make sure you have a domain name. Domain names aren't usually expensive, and you can buy a <strong>.com</strong> for around a tenner from<a href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/c/5003685/408749/5618"> NameCheap</a>, or even go with with more esoteric options such as <strong><a href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/c/5003685/624649/5618">.xyz</a></strong>,or <strong><a href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/c/5003685/891913/5618">.gay</a></strong>, for around $2 (These are affiliate links, obviously). </p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">There are usually special offers where you can snap up something suitable for a few dollars. Alternatively, you can get a completely <a href="https://linuximpact.com/how-to-get-a-free-domain-name-to-use-with-your-new-web-project/">free domain names</a> from freenom with a variety of TLDs - be warned though, you won't actually own these names, just have use of them.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">You also need somewhere to store your static files. Sure, you can buy hosting - and there are some pretty <a href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/c/5003685/624623/5618">good hosting deals</a> (again, this is an affiliate link) out there , but you don't need to. It's pretty easy to <a href="https://linuximpact.com/turn-your-old-pc-or-laptop-into-a-server-and-own-your-own-piece-of-the-internet/">convert an old PC or laptop to a server</a>, or use a cheap and low-power <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Computer-Suitable-Workstation/dp/B0899VXM8F/ref=sr_1_3?crid=16G7DHNEVDVBH&amp;keywords=raspberry+pi+8gb&amp;qid=1699266630&amp;sprefix=raspberry+pi+8gb%252Caps%252C152&amp;sr=8-3&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=thecrowuk-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=0f9dee46e8b8e6c27a2421c530833bac&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Raspberry Pi</a> as a server.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Another option is to use Github Pages to host your static files. This is what we do. It's completely free, and provided you're not pushing out porn, you can use the service to host whatever you want.</p>

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">In the <strong>Server</strong> section of Publii's interface, you'll see an alarming number of options. If you've gone with traditional hosting, you'll probably want to select <strong>FTP</strong> or <strong>SFTP</strong>. Input your website URL, the port number, and other details, then save. The options are similar regardless what you choose.</p>
<p>Hit the big <strong>Sync your website</strong> button, and your content will be magically uploaded to your service of choice.</p>
<p>Alternatively, select <strong>Zip</strong> as your server type to have Publii produce a zip archive of your content that you can upload manually.</p>
<h2 id="h-is-publii-right-for-you">Is Publii right for you?</h2>
<p>Probably, yes. Provided that what you're providing is simply static content, then Publii is the perfect publishing tool, giving you a fast, responsive website that looks great, costs nothing, and just works.</p>
<p>If you're selling something, or need a database then traditional hosting is a better option.</p>
<h2 id="h-expose-yourself-to-the-world">Expose yourself to the world</h2>
<p>Once your website is online, it's accessible to everyone, so be careful what details you put on it. While it's natural to want to give visitors some means of getting in contact with you, please don't put your home address on your website, and take some steps to <a href="https://linuximpact.com/protect-your-inbox-from-spam-and-online-threats/">disguise your email address</a> as well.</p>

                <p>RSS feeds power the internet - The parts of it worth reading anyway. With a decent RSS reader, you can skim headlines or excepts, you can get the most important news on your favourite topics without ever having to visit the sites themselves.</p>
<p>Feedburner is a web feed management service founded in 2004, and offered custom RSS feeds and management tools to bloggers. There are were some huge advantages for websites using Feedsburner to power their feeds. Statistics and analytics, for example; browser-friendly versions instead of ugly XML files; email sign-up options.</p>
<p>But relying on external services to provide feeds leaves readers vulnerable if the feed is taken over by a a squatter. Who wants their feeds full of affiliate spam, cruft, crap, and scams? No-one, that's who.</p>
<p>But that's what happened to TechCrunch in 2021.</p>
<h2 id="h-techcrunch-has-had-a-rocky-relationship-with-feedburner">TechCrunch had a rocky relationship with FeedBurner</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/bonfire.jpg" alt="silhouette of a man in front of a blazing bonfire" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/bonfire-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/bonfire-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/bonfire-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/bonfire-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/bonfire-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/bonfire-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Way back in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050730022437/http://www.techcrunch.com/">June 2005</a>, TechCrunch, not yet a tech media powerhouse, was a "weblog dedicated to obsessively profiling and reviewing every newly launched web 2.0 business and service".</p>
<p>Hosted on WordPress 1.5.1, Techcrunch was the place to go if you wanted to read about the launch of Google reviews, the proliferation of new search engines, or an explanation of what web2.0 actually was.</p>
<p>They also had good things to say about the FeedBurner service:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One reason a blog or website owner would want to use this is because it simplifies the RSS feed. The Feed URL for Techcrunch, for instance, is “http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch”, which is a much simpler format that standard RSS feeds.... And if a site can get most of its readers to use the single Feedburner feed, they can take advantage of the great statistics and tools to see where readers are coming from and what they are clicking on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'd disagree that the TechCrunch FeedBurner URL is a simpler format, and a quick look on archive.org shows that the TechCrunch had two native feeds at the time: http://www.techcrunch.com/?feed=rss and http://www.techcrunch.com/?feed=atom.</p>
<p>Sure, the URLs contain a "?", but the overall length was shorter, and besides, links are for clicking, not for copying out by hand - but we digress. TechCrunch clearly preferred the FeedBurner service, most likely because, "it can automatically add Google Adsense adds to your feeds, allowing you to easily generate revenue if you have a large enough audience". </p>
<p>TechCrunch switched to FeedBurner the following month. </p>
<p>Google acquired FeedBurner in 2007, and by 2012, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/28/the-feedburner-deathwatch-continues-google-kills-adsense-for-feeds/" rel="nofollow">TechCrunch had the service on deathwatch</a> after Google shuttered its adsense integration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many publishers (including TechCrunch) rely on the service to publish their RSS feeds. It’s time to reconsider this as the writing is clearly on the wall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They didn't reconsider it though, and the TechCrunch Feedburner feed was regularly updated with every story and article until late 2021.</p>
<h2 id="h-failing-to-heed-your-own-warning">Failing to heed their own warning</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/ears.jpg" alt="A bearded man holding both hands up to his ears" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/ears-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/ears-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/ears-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/ears-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/ears-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/ears-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>We started subscribing to TechCrunch via RSS at some point in 2018 - somewhere around the time that TechCrunch was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/07/rss-is-undead/">loudly proclaiming</a> the death of RSS as a useful technology.</p>
<p>We can't remember where we found the URL - the official feed on the main site was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/feed/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://techcrunch.com/feed/</a> at the time (and still is). It was probably through search results or an aggregated list of cool feeds to follow. Either way, the official FeedBurner feed was ticking along nicely. Doubtless forgotten by the TechCrunch admins, but, like a dying postman in a post-apocalyptic world, dutifully updating RSS clients around the world with the latest on Silicon Valley startups, interesting innovations, and the imminent arrival of Web 3.0 (yawn).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/googles-feedburner-moves-to-a-new-infrastructure-but-loses-its-email-subscription-service/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">April 2021</a>, TechCrunch reported that Google would soon move Feedburner to a new infrastructure, and once again plugged its own FeedBurner URL - at the same time noting that the upcoming changes had the potential to create a bit of a mess:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And despite everything, shutting it down would probably break enough tools for publishers to create quite an uproar. The TechCrunch RSS feed, to which you are surely subscribed in your desktop RSS reader, is http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/, after all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. That was a live link, BTW.</p>
<h2 id="h-the-confusion">The confusion</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/techcrunch_freshrss_feed.jpg" alt="TechCrunch RSS feed as viewed through FreshRSS" width="1680" height="636" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/techcrunch_freshrss_feed-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/techcrunch_freshrss_feed-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/techcrunch_freshrss_feed-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/techcrunch_freshrss_feed-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/techcrunch_freshrss_feed-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/techcrunch_freshrss_feed-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>We're not sure how exactly the FeedBurner infrastructure shift went down, but we're certain that as TechCrunch predicted, it was a shitshow, and yes, it did break publisher tools, despite <a href="https://support.google.com/feedburner/answer/10483501">assurances from Google</a> that, "All existing feeds will continue to serve uninterrupted".</p>
<p>Pruning the feeds on our <a href="https://linuximpact.com/freshrss-stay-safe-and-never-visit-another-website-again/">fabulous self-hosted FreshRSS instance</a> last week, we noticed that we hadn't favourited any TechCrunch articles for a while. Our instance is set to purge content over a certain age unless it's been favourited.</p>
<p>Historically we had liked, on average, one TechCrunch article per month enough to keep it permanently on our servers.</p>
<p>Highlights include headlines such as "We must end the era of adjunct surveillance" from August 2021 at which we were outraged and disgusted, and "Panic sells 20,000+ Playdate handhelds in under 20 minutes" from a month earlier, about which we were delighted.</p>
<p>Our last favourited TechCrunch article received over RSS was titled "Amazon will pay you $10 in credit for your palm print biometrics", at which we literally facepalmed (Boom!).</p>
<p>After that there's nothing - at least nothing we've found engaging enough to mark.</p>
<h2 id="h-under-new-management">Under new management</h2>
<p>An article from the TechCrunch feed posted in October 2021 - a mere six months after TechCrunch's article on the upcoming Infrastructure changes was titled, "China Could Be Exploiting Internet Security Process to Steal Data, Cyber Experts Warn". It doesn't scan as being particularly Crunch-y, and although informative, it doesn't read quite right either. The article isn't engaging (but hey, who has a 100% hit rate?), and the byline is "noreply@blogger.com".</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/techcrunch_china_story.jpg" alt="A news article with the headline: China Could Be Exploiting Internet Security Process to Steal Data, Cyber Experts Warn" width="1680" height="744" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/techcrunch_china_story-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/techcrunch_china_story-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/techcrunch_china_story-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/techcrunch_china_story-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/techcrunch_china_story-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/techcrunch_china_story-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>The page it links to is on the now-defunct https://techncruncher.blogspot.com blog. Running the content through a free plagiarism detector, reveals that the exact same content is on dozens of sites, including the Freedom First Network - an alt-right leaning outlet that (on a random sampling of its other pages) views Democrats as facists, and has headlines such as "Planned Parenthood is Selling the Bodies of Dead Babies to the CCP to Develop Bioweapons to Use Against Americans", and "Do Black people owe White people reparations for slavery". We suspect this is where the story originated.</p>
<p>Move forwards through the TechCrunch feed, and you'll see more plausible headlines. Some are tech-related such as, "Most Frequently Asked Questions About NFTs(Non-Fungible Tokens)"; some are typical of the kind of low-quality SEO fodder you'd find on other, tech-adjacent sites, such as "Ginger VS Grammarly: Which Grammar Checker is Better in (2022) ?" </p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">There's a tonne of pop culture and movie lists.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/cenobites.jpg" alt="Supposed TechCrunch story: Hellraiser: The 5 Best &amp; 5 Worst Cenobites In The Whole Franchise" width="1914" height="958" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/cenobites-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/cenobites-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/cenobites-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/cenobites-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/cenobites-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/55/responsive/cenobites-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img  src="Supposed techcruch story with the headline Hellraiser: The 5 Best &amp; 5 Worst Cenobites In The Whole Franchise" alt="" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">In February 2022, the linked domain moved to crunchhype.com, and the pop culture disappeared in favour of affiliate marketing and SEO based articles. Buried in there someone is, we would assume, an exhortation to take control of neglected RSS feeds to shill your stuff.</p>
<h2 id="h-wider-implications-for-xxx">There are wider implications for abandoned accounts</h2>
<p>Websites live and die all the time, and their RSS feeds are taken over by squatters and legitimate new owners.</p>
<p>The difference is that if a website of TechCrunch's size had died, we'd have heard about it and become suspicious that their feed was still coming through.</p>
<p>TechCrunch is obviously still alive, and we had little reason to think that one of their official RSS channels had been taken over.</p>
<p>Had the squatter's headline writers been better, we might have actually opened one of their spammy articles, and believed what was written therein.</p>
<p>We don't know if you've heard the news, but Twitter will soon start selling disused handles in an effort to shore up the finances of Elon Musk's rapidly depopulating media empire.</p>
<p>These are, presumably, accounts with a lot of followers, and the opportunity for plausible disinformation from people you'd forgotten you follow will be huge.</p>
<p>Yes, the costs will be high, but consider that buying followers through promoted accounts costs around $2 per follower, we can see an incoming tsunami of shit.</p>

                <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Sudo is probably the most important command you'll ever use on Linux. It gives you god-like powers in the terminal, and the ability to do absolutely anything you want in the terminal (for good or evil).</p>
<p>"sudo: command not found" isn't a common error, but if you don't fix it, you won't be able to update packages, install software, or even perform basic maintanence.</p>
<h2 id="h-what-is-the-sudo-command-used-for-on-linux">What is the sudo command used for on Linux?</h2>
<p>Unless you make a habit of logging into Linux as <strong>root</strong> (never a good idea), you have to preface any privileged command with <strong>sudo</strong>. Sudo gives you the mystical powers of a super user, and without it, you're more-or-less restricted to launching already installed applications, or creating and manipulating files in your <strong>home</strong> directory.</p>
<p>For a complete description of what sudo can be used for and how to use it, enter the following command into a terminal:</p>
<p><code>man sudo</code></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/47/man-sudo.png" alt="Man page entry for sudo" width="1680" height="924" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/47/responsive/man-sudo-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/47/responsive/man-sudo-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/47/responsive/man-sudo-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/47/responsive/man-sudo-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/47/responsive/man-sudo-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/47/responsive/man-sudo-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Without <strong>sudo</strong>, most of the filesystem will be inaccessible to you, and you won't be able to elevate your privilege to perform any restricted operations.</p>
<p>In a recent analysis of <a href="https://linuximpact.com/discover-your-most-used-linux-commands-with-muc/">most-used Linux commands</a> , we found <strong>sudo</strong> to be our third most used command overall.</p>
<h2 id="h-why-is-the-the-sudo-command-not-found-where-did-sudo-go">Why is the the sudo command not found? Where did sudo go?</h2>
<p>Sudo <em>should</em> installed on most Linux systems when you set them up for the first time, and by default, the sudo binary is located in <strong>/usr/bin/sudo</strong>.</p>
<p>We've seen the "Sudo: Command Not Found" message several times - usually after installing a new Linux system on a remote VPS or on a virtual machine.</p>
<p>You can actual force this error by deleting sudo with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt remove /usr/bin/sudo</code></pre>
<p>...or by accidentally moving it to another location.</p>
<p>Your first response on finding that sudo isn't installed might be to try and install sudo with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install sudo</code></pre>
<p>Your terminal may even helpfully suggest that you use the above command. However, as you don't have sudo installed, you don't have the necessary privileges to install sudo.</p>
<p>If you receive the error message: "Sudo: Command Not Found", the first thing you should do is check if <strong>sudo</strong> is present on your system.</p>
<p>Open a terminal and enter:</p>
<pre><code>ls /usr/bin/sudo</code></pre>
<p>If sudo isn't present, you'll see the following message:<strong> ls: cannot access '/usr/bin/sudod': No such file or directory</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="h-heres-the-simple-fix-for-sudo-command-not-found-on-linux">Here's the simple fix for "Sudo: Command Not Found" on Linux</h2>
<p>The root account on Linux doesn't need to use <strong>sudo</strong> in order to install packages, and fortunately, it's easy to get root access on your physical machine or VM.</p>
<p>Restart Linux, either by selecting <strong>log out &gt; restart</strong> or simply <strong>restart</strong> from your power or system menu.</p>
<p>Alternatively, power off your machine, then turn it on again.</p>
<p>As soon as your PC starts to boot, press and hold <strong>shift</strong> or <strong>Escape</strong> to bring up the <strong>grub</strong> menu.</p>
<p>Choose <strong>Advanced Options</strong> then select the most recent kernel version with <strong>Recovery mode</strong>.</p>

                <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Everyone remembers their first experience with Linux. For some, it was a revelation, and a lifting of proprietary scales</p>
<p>For others it was a confusing installation procedure, followed by bafflement as nothing was where it should be and it "didn't look like Windows".</p>
<p>For most people (by which we mean current Linux enthusiasts and users), that first experience was Ubuntu - thanks to its eye-catching design work, and its adherence to the AOL model of CD distribution. This author hasn't had an optical drive in half a decade but still possesses a stack of shiny Ubuntu coasters.</p>
<p>Hard-headed tech nerds shouldn't get nostalgia, but we do, and it's often tempting to polish off the old bicycle and take a meandering trip down Memory Lane to revisit earlier incarnations of operating systems* we once knew, loved, and lauded as the greatest thing ever.</p>
<p>But the official Ubuntu website only has downloads for version 20.04.06 onward, and while their <a href="https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">old releases</a> subdomain stocks ISO images all the way back to 4.10 (Warty Warthog), downloads are slow, and it's a chore to set up an entire virtual machine just because you get teary-eyed for the biscuit-coloured wallpaper.</p>
<h2 id="h-sail-the-high-distroseas">Sail the high (Distro)Seas</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/distrosea-distros.jpg" alt="logos for18 of the distrosea distros" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/distrosea-distros-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/distrosea-distros-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/distrosea-distros-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/distrosea-distros-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/distrosea-distros-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/distrosea-distros-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p><a href="https://distrosea.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DistroSea</a> came online in May 2023, and to date, offers 50 Linux distros and with a total of over 400 versions to play with in your browser. It's a cool tool you can use to get an idea of the look and feel of a distro before you go through the trouble of downloading and installing an ISO - although we wouldn't recommend using one of Distrosea's VMs as your daily driver.</p>
<p>Don't get too excited just yet. If you're looking for rarities, you'll be disappointed. You won't find HJ Lu's seminal distro (appropriately called Distro) being spun up on a virtual 5.25" floppy drive, nor 1992's GUI-tastic MCC Interim Linux. Even the Debian images only go back as far as Debian 10 (Buster).</p>
<p>If you're a fan of antique Ubuntu desktops and can't wait to get your hands on some ancient simulated tech, you'll find that DistroSea has every release of Ubuntu, as well as the Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Kubuntu, Budgie, Kylin, mate, and Studio all the way back to Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft). OK, so it's not Warty Warthog, but Edgy Eft was released in October 2006.</p>
<p>If you want some contextual landmarks for how long ago that really was, in October 2006 Google bought YouTube for a bargain $1.65 billion, Israel was in the process of de-occupying Lebanon, and the population of the United States was 34 million less than it is today.</p>
<p>This writer's daughter was two months old, and tonight she's going to a concert in Manchester. 17 years is longer than you think.</p>
<h2 id="h-trawling-the-distrosea-ocean">Trawling the DistroSea ocean</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/latency.jpg" alt="Graph showing distrosea availability and latency" width="904" height="400" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/latency-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/latency-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/latency-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/latency-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/latency-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/latency-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>There are a few things you should be aware of when you spin up an image on DistroSea. The first is that you need to log in if you want to use the internet on these virtual machines. Logging in requires a Google account - anathema to privacy conscious Netizens.</p>
<p>We imagine this is because if you get up to any no-good, immoral, or outright illegal highjinks, the person with the Google account is on the hook rather than the site owners.</p>
<p>The second thing is latency. It's not bad, but it's definitely there - especially when the service is busy.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/queueing-for-xubuntu.jpg" alt="A screen with the xubuntu logo indicating the users place in the queue and estimated wait time" width="1858" height="816" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/queueing-for-xubuntu-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/queueing-for-xubuntu-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/queueing-for-xubuntu-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/queueing-for-xubuntu-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/queueing-for-xubuntu-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/queueing-for-xubuntu-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>The third thing is the wait times. DistroSea is run on limited resources, and after clicking <strong>start</strong>, you'll be placed in a queue until there's an available slot. As far as we could ascertain from running <strong>top</strong> in the Ubuntu terminal, there are up to eight users per machine.</p>
<p>Don't think about switching to another tab while you wait though. If you're more than (we'd guess) a minute AFK, you'll lose your place and the session will close.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/eft-desktop.jpg" alt="The edgy eft desktop with firefox, tetris and top running" width="1680" height="1260" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/eft-desktop-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/eft-desktop-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/eft-desktop-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/eft-desktop-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/eft-desktop-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/eft-desktop-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Edgy Eft was fun and kind of put things in perspective for the early Ubuntu landscape. In October 2006 when it was first released, the flagship Microsoft OS was Windows XP. In looks, usability, and customisation options alone, Ubuntu dominated utterly, and its superiority would only become more obvious with the release of Windows Vista the next month. MacOS meanwhile was on its "Tiger" release - all brushed metal and big icons.</p>
<p>Our next stop on the nostaligia cruise was Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) for the sole reason that this writer bought and immediately voided the warranty on a spanky new Dell Chromebook just to run Precise Pangolin.</p>
<p>It was good despite some questionable design decisions, and is to our mind, the definitive Ubuntu release - although that could just be the way it looks through our rose-tinted glasses.</p>
<h2 id="h-discover-buried-linux-treasure">Discover buried Linux treasure</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/island.jpg" alt="Man standing on a small island in an underground cave. A shaft of sunlight illuminates the sand behind him" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/island-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/island-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/island-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/island-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/island-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/island-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Spinning up old distros brings to mind the best and worst of Linux has going for it, and the parts that fall into both camps.</p>
<p>The fact that there are just so very many distros and so many ways of doing things points to what naysayers would call fragmention. And while that's sort-of technically true, it misses the point that open-source software allows you to do whatever you want to it, rebrand, and re-release. It's evolution, and the people who take part are passionate about it - which is a good thing.</p>
<p>The kind of release schedule you get with Ubuntu - and Linux in general is fantastic too, and we get to try new things more often than users of other operating systems.</p>
<p>Ubuntu is clearly the oldest distro available on DistroSea, but for a taste of not-quite-so-distant-past, it's also worth taking a sly gander at Slackware 14.0, which was released in September 2012, making it a mere month younger than the venerable and much maligned Windows 8.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/slackware-kde-widgets.jpg" alt="Slackware linux with a variety of cool KDE widgets" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/slackware-kde-widgets-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/slackware-kde-widgets-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/slackware-kde-widgets-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/slackware-kde-widgets-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/slackware-kde-widgets-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/46/responsive/slackware-kde-widgets-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>As firm window manager enthusiasts, we'd forgotten all about KDE widgets, but DistroSea gave us a chance to play with desktop customisation via dragging widgets again. Fun times.</p>
<p>Once you've reconciled your reminiscences, take a minute to use DistroSea as it was meant to be used: as a way to try out your next distro</p>
<p>Indulge your curiosity with other distros like Big Linux (it isn't actually that big) See how the other half lives for an hour. Don't like systemd? try Devuan? Hate your boring, reliable Debian install, activate Arch for an afternoon.</p>
<h2 id="h-will-distrosea-sink-or-swim">Will DistroSea sink or swim?</h2>
<p>DistroSea has been around for a few months now, but there's no guarantee it will be there forever.</p>
<p>The developer and owner is <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/basilky/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">active on Reddit</a>, but is busy with work and other commitments, DistroSea appears to be a hobby project, but the resources it consumes are not trivial. We haven't been able to find a funding model, and we can only hope it doesn't disappear beneath the waves like its spiritual predecessor, DistroTest.</p>

                <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Trust is a hard thing to come by in the 21st century, and relying on third party services to keep your private communications private is a mug's game.</p>
<p>Right now, the most popular instant messaging app in the world is WhatsApp - a proprietary service owned and operated by Meta - the company formerly know as FaceBook - that routinely coughs of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=facebook+privacy+fines">hundreds of millions in fines</a> to pay for its egregious privacy-related offences.</p>
<p>In case you needed reminding, Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, once referred to unsuspecting users who handed over their data to his nascent company as "<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2010/05/14/facebook_trust_dumb/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">dumb fucks</a>". The Zuck's comments were made in 2004 - a more innocent time - but nearly two decades later, WhatsApp has more than 2 billion active users worldwide, sending 100 billion messages daily as well as making video calls, sending voice notes, and of cause, the ubiquitous duck-faced selfie.</p>
<p>That's a lot of data to entrust to a company that makes its money from scraping up data about your life, tracking you across the internet (and in the real world), and then selling that data on.</p>
<p>For us, it's not acceptable, and despite Meta's assurances that our data would be perfectly safe with them, we'd prefer not to take the risk. More to the point, we'd prefer a solution which kept our data and messages securely under our control.</p>
<h2 id="h-wtf-is-snikket">WTF is Snikket?</h2>
<p>You've probably never heard of Snikket, and none of your friends use it either.</p>
<p>Snikket is an easy-to-deploy XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) server that can be up and running in virtually no time on a Raspberry Pi, VPS, or any random PC hardware you stumble across.<br><br>With Snikkett, you can create, own, and administer your own messaging service for friends, family, and casual acquaintances.</p>
<p>By running an XMPP instance on your own hardware, you can install the Snikket app on your devices, and communicate with your other Snikket users without any danger of being snooped on by predatory corps, or other interested parties. You'll also have the option of sending your messages unencrypted, secured with OMEMO (OMEMO Multi-End Message and Object Encryption) multi-end to multi-end encryption, or classic OpenPGP.</p>
<p>XMPP is capable of federating, meaning that users on your Snikket instance can communicate with users on any other XMPP instance, too. It's wild.</p>
<p>As you'd expect from a modern messaging app, your communications aren't limited to texts like it's 1999, and you have the full gamut of mid 21st century functionality. Send kisses to your spouse, a voice note of everlasting adoration to your paramour, a dick pic to your side-piece, and apology videos to all of them.</p>
<p>Snikket doesn't require much in the way of hardware to run, and a Raspberry Pi 4B will be ample for a family-sized instance. We've been running Snikket alongside an entire stable of self-hosted services including<a href="https://linuximpact.com/immich-is-the-killer-app-that-will-kick-start-the-self-hosting-revolution/"> Immich</a>, <a href="https://linuximpact.com/self-host-your-own-audio-library-with-audiobookshelf/">Audiobookshelf</a>, <a href="https://linuximpact.com/mealie-probably-the-best-self-hosted-recipe-manager-in-the-world/">Mealie</a><a href="https://linuximpact.com/mealie-probably-the-best-self-hosted-recipe-manager-in-the-world/"></a>, <a href="https://linuximpact.com/forget-net-nanny-pihole-will-keep-your-kids-late-night-activity-in-check/">Pihole</a>, Jellyfin,Nextcloud, and more. We haven't encountered any problems at all.</p>
<p>You'll need to register a domain name, too. We use <a href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/c/5003685/890712/5618">Namecheap</a> (affiliate link) for all of ours. </p>

<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/45/kitchen_pi-2.jpg" alt="Silver-cased Raspberry Pi 4B on a granite kitchen counter " width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/45/responsive/kitchen_pi-2-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/45/responsive/kitchen_pi-2-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/45/responsive/kitchen_pi-2-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/45/responsive/kitchen_pi-2-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/45/responsive/kitchen_pi-2-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/45/responsive/kitchen_pi-2-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>We're using the Raspberry Pi because a server needs to be on 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. It needs to be reliable, and ideally, shouldn't draw a huge amount of power. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Computer-Suitable-Workstation/dp/B0899VXM8F/ref=sr_1_3?crid=16G7DHNEVDVBH&amp;keywords=raspberry+pi+8gb&amp;qid=1699266630&amp;sprefix=raspberry+pi+8gb%252Caps%252C152&amp;sr=8-3&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=thecrowuk-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=0f9dee46e8b8e6c27a2421c530833bac&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Raspberry Pi 4B</a> pulls a mere 8 Watts - the equivalent of a low energy lightbulb, and reliability is improved by a pair of solid state drives (SSDs) in place of a failure-prone Micro SD card. Earlier models, such as the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3, can also run a Snikket instance without problems - although we haven't tried this ourselves.</p>
<p>That said, these instructions should work on any computer hardware from the last 15 years that you happen to have lying around making the place look untidy.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://snikket.org/service/quickstart/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">quickstart guide</a> on the Snikket website concisely sum up everything you need to get Snikket up and running in a hurry, although please do make sure that you read the linked page on which ports you need to open on your router and firewall.</p>
<p>It's only if you're running Snikket behind a reverse proxy that you'll run into trouble.</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://snikket.org/service/help/advanced/reverse_proxy/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Snikket Operators Guide</a> offers an exhaustive catalogue of reverse proxy example configs, you'll also need to make some changes to your docker-compose file - else Snikket will fail to initialise, and you'll see an endless stream of "Waiting for certificates" when you check the logs.</p>
<p>After you use Let's Encrypt to obtain an SSL certificate for your main domain, you need to mount your certificates directory as a volume in both the <strong>snikket_server</strong> and <strong>snikket-proxy</strong> containers. While you have your docker-compose.yml open in nano, take the opportunity to nuke the <strong>snikket-proxy</strong> container, too.</p>
<p>Our Snikket Docker Compose file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>version: "3.3"

services:
  snikket_proxy:
    container_name: snikket-proxy
    image: snikket/snikket-web-proxy:beta
    env_file: snikket.conf
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - snikket_data:/snikket
      - acme_challenges:/var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge
      - /etc/letsencrypt:/snikket/letsencrypt
    restart: "unless-stopped"

  snikket_portal:
    container_name: snikket-portal
    image: snikket/snikket-web-portal:beta
    network_mode: host
    env_file: snikket.conf
    restart: "unless-stopped"

  snikket_server:
    container_name: snikket
    image: snikket/snikket-server:beta
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - snikket_data:/snikket
      - /etc/letsencrypt:/snikket/letsencrypt
    env_file: snikket.conf
    restart: "unless-stopped"

volumes:
  acme_challenges:
  snikket_data:
</code></pre>
<p>You also need to add the following lines to <strong>snikket.conf</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>SNIKKET_TWEAK_HTTP_PORT=5080
SNIKKET_TWEAK_HTTPS_PORT=5443</code></pre>
<p>Start Snikket with:</p>
<pre><code>docker-compose up -d</code></pre>
<p>...and create an admin account link with:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec snikket create-invite --admin --group default</code></pre>
<p>That's it. Well done, open a browser, paste the link, and create the admin account on your server.</p>

</div></div>
<p>Snikket has it's own mobile app which is available from <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.snikket.android/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">F-Droid</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.snikket.android" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Google Play</a>, and Apple's <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/snikket/id1545164189" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">App store</a>. However, it will work perfectly well with any generic XMPP client, so if you already have a favourite, or prefer the UX of a different app, feel free to use that instead.</p>
<p>Open the app, and you'll be asked to sign in. Your username is what you created during the admin setup, and will be in the format <strong>yourname@yourdomain.tld</strong>.</p>
<p>The Snikket interface is kind of sparse. You have no contacts (unless the people in your contacts lists have XMPP addresses ), but you can add contacts, create private groups, and discover channels using the big plus sign in the lower right portion of the screen.</p>
<p>And there are thousands of channels to join, so even if you have no friends in real life, you can still find people to talk to. A quick search for "Linux" yielded dozens of rooms dedicated to everything from Arch (BTW) to city-specific user groups. Of course, if you don't want to chat with the entire world, you can always decline to open port 5269. This will disable federation (there's probably another way to do it, but this sprung to mind as the most obvious).</p>
<p>To add other users to your instance, open the web admin panel at <strong>your-domain.tld/admin/</strong>, then click <strong>Manage Users</strong>, and <strong>Create new invitation</strong>. Copy the link and send it by email, text. or carrier pigeon. Alternatively, you can generate a QR code on your mobile device for them to scan.</p>
<p>Anyone who accepts your link will be automatically added as a contact, and as part of your circle. You can create and manage more circles through the admin panel.</p>
<h2 id="h-using-snikket-with-friends-and-fam">Using Snikket with friends and fam</h2>
<p>As a privacy-oriented individual, this writer has had limited options when communicating with others. Autocrypted chat over email via <a href="https://linuximpact.com/delta-chat-going-old-school-with-the-future-of-messaging-apps/">Delta Chat</a> has been pretty good for sending pictures, texts, and voice notes. But the options for self-hosted video and voice calls have been limited, and either resource hungry, or fairly involved to set up.</p>
<p>Snikket changes that, and runs on extremely limited hardware. And you've already seen how very easy, and very quick it is to get up and running.</p>
<p>Voice and video calls have been (so far), flawless, high quality, and trouble free, and it's genuinely a joy to use. We've been sending memes at midnight, making calls around the clock, sharing our location with the lads, and getting some quality face-to-face with friends. </p>
<p>Bear in mind though, if you have a large number of users, and anticipate that they'll all be calling simulataneously, you may need to expand the port range.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a first rate and effective messaging platform for the family unit, Snikket has opened up the world of XMPP. Thousands of channels, and yet more ways to waste time in the supermarket line.</p>
<p>It's cool. You should <a href="https://snikket.org/">check it out.</a></p>

                <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Self-hosting sites and services from home is a pleasure and a joy - as well as being an all-consuming hobby that gives us more headaches than it should.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Computer-Suitable-Workstation/dp/B0899VXM8F/ref=sr_1_3?crid=16G7DHNEVDVBH&amp;keywords=raspberry+pi+8gb&amp;qid=1699266630&amp;sprefix=raspberry+pi+8gb%252Caps%252C152&amp;sr=8-3&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=thecrowuk-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=0f9dee46e8b8e6c27a2421c530833bac&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raspberry Pi 4B</a> is more than capable of providing extensive services for an extended family - furnishing them with an <a href="https://linuximpact.com/self-host-your-own-audio-library-with-audiobookshelf/">Audiobook server</a>; streaming movies, shows, and music through Jellyfin; office suite and slot-in Drive replacement through courtesy of NextCloud; a <a href="https://social.rutland.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fediverse</a> server (eschewed by everyone but this writer); Photo upload, and gallery with <a href="https://linuximpact.com/immich-is-the-killer-app-that-will-kick-start-the-self-hosting-revolution/">Immich</a>, an email server and Snappymail frontend; and even more services that we can't recall right now.</p>
<p>The humble Pi has even, in the past, been used to host public-facing websites.</p>
<p>Hosting a website from home is a gratifying and traumatic experience, and your experience will vary depending on exactly how you decide to set it up.</p>
<p><a href="https://thecrow.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Crow</a> - a site now on semi-permanent hiatus, and from which several of the articles on Linux Imact were culled - was created as a static site using Jekyll. The writing was done in the Atom editor, and files were shuffled off onto the Pi using SCP (Secure Copy).</p>
<p>Most of the time, the site ticked along happily, and was relatively unperturbed even under heavy traffic - one notable exception being when traffic to an article about <a href="https://thecrow.uk/A-Gov.uk-site-dedicated-to-porn-Absolutely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">porn being hosted on a Department of Transport subdomain</a> forced the site onto a VPS for a short period.</p>
<h2 id="h-wordpress-on-a-pi-isnt-always-the-optimal-solution">WordPress on a Pi isn't always the optimal solution</h2>
<p><a href="https://linuximpact.com">Linux Impact</a> is younger than you may think - popping into existence after a domain name purchase on November 6th 2023, and certain decisions were made in an unconsidered rush.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/old-linux-impact.jpg" alt="An ugly Wordpress site with red and grey colour scheme" width="1680" height="774" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/old-linux-impact-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/old-linux-impact-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/old-linux-impact-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/old-linux-impact-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/old-linux-impact-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/old-linux-impact-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>The first of these was to use WordPress as a content management system. WordPress is great software, and there's a reason it powers more than half of the websites online today.</p>
<p>It was...fine. It's easy to get a website looking <em>OK</em> quickly, and there's no messing around with text editors.</p>
<p>And everything worked well until we start getting decent amounts of traffic. After appearing on the HN front page, we were quickly forced offline - struggling under numbers that a static site would have handled with ease.</p>
<p>Yes, we could have eased the burden by using a CDN to deliver images and other content from elsewhere on the web, and we did seriously consider doing exactly that.</p>
<p>But once we arrived at the realisation that it wasn't entirely practical to completely host this website on a bargain basement SBC and a domestic internet connection, we started to wonder why we were hosting it at home in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="h-making-better-design-decisions">Making better design decisions</h2>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/designer.jpg" alt="" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/designer-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/designer-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/designer-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/designer-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/designer-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/designer-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>The first decision we made was that <em>all</em><strong><em> </em></strong>content was going to be hosted offsite. <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Pages</a> was the natural choice, as hosting is both free and fast - although there's an ever present nagging feeling that current owner, Microsoft, will, at some point, pull the rug and spiral into service enshitification.</p>
<p>You can host any content you like on Github Pages. You can use your own domain name, and they'll even throw in SSL certs for free. It's pretty easy to set up, with the only proviso being that the content needs to be static. If you're hosting a web shop, or anything that requires users to sign in, static sites probably aren't for you anyway.</p>
<p>While WordPress is excellent as a content management system, and it's possible to create a site using WorPress and export it as static pages, it's a bit fiddly for our tastes, and we've always found messing around with themes, layouts and widgets to be an annoyance rather than a feature.</p>
<p>Jekyll was an option. Writing Markdown and creating sites with Jekyll is fun, but now that Atom, our favourite text editor has been archived, it's not as much fun as it used to be.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/publii-marketplace.jpg" alt="The Publii marketplace showing a selection of themes" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-marketplace-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-marketplace-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-marketplace-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-marketplace-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-marketplace-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-marketplace-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Publii is a static site generator with all the bells and whistles you can imagine, and a for producing and editing posts, it's not all that different from the back-end of a WordPress blog: convenience, a variety of editors, a marketplace for themes and plugins. While our WordPress instance was periodically dropping offline and heroically resurfacing, we were able to port our meagre content into Publii, and get set up for free on GitHub.</p>
<p>Sure, GitHub pages has usage limits, but they're quite generous:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GitHub Pages source repositories have a recommended limit of 1 GB. For more information, see "<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#file-and-repository-size-limitations" aria-roledescription="hover card" aria-describedby="popover-describedby">About large files on GitHub</a>"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Published GitHub Pages sites may be no larger than 1 GB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GitHub Pages deployments will timeout if they take longer than 10 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GitHub Pages sites have a <em>soft</em> bandwidth limit of 100 GB per month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GitHub Pages sites have a <em>soft</em> limit of 10 builds per hour. This limit does not apply if you build and publish your site with a custom GitHub Actions workflow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to provide consistent quality of service for all GitHub Pages sites, rate limits may apply. These rate limits are not intended to interfere with legitimate uses of GitHub Pages. If your request triggers rate limiting, you will receive an appropriate response with an HTTP status code of <code>429</code>, along with an informative HTML body.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>We very much doubt we're going to hit those limits.</p>
<h2 id="h-creating-static-sites-is-simple-with-publii">Creating static sites is simple with Publii</h2>
<p>Publii is Free software licensed under GPL3. This means you can use it, distribute, modify, and redistribute with your own modifications (provided any modifications are distributed under the same license) however you want. You can buy, sell, and trade copies if you want - although that seems kind of pointless since the developers have made binaries for Windows, MacOS, and Linux available from the main <a href="https://getpublii.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Publii website</a>.</p>
<p>Installation on our Debian-based system was as easy as popping a terminal and entering:</p>
<pre><code>wget https://getpublii.com/download/Publii-0.44.0.deb
sudo dpkg -i https://getpublii.com/download/Publii-0.44.0.deb</code></pre>
<p>...and in a matter of minutes the app was installed and accessible from the system menu (it's a fairly hefty package, so the actual download took around 300 seconds ).</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/publii-create-site.jpg" alt="Create new site dialogue, showing icons, Site name and author name" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-create-site-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-create-site-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-create-site-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-create-site-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-create-site-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-create-site-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Start Publii, and you'll be asked to accept the GNU GPL3 license then be asked to give your website a name, and choose a name for the primary author. You can also choose an adorable little icon to represent yourself and the site within Publii. We went with a steaming hot cup of coffee. Hit the big blue button and get started.</p>
<p>This is where our experience most likely differed from most Publii users, because we weren't creating a website from scratch - we already had our struggling WordPress instance.</p>
<p>Following the very well-written and understandable Publii instructions, we logged into WordPress, and from the admin panel clicked <strong>tools &gt; export</strong> to download an XML file containing posts, authors, category, and tag content. The file itself is only a few hundred kilobytes, so took only moments.</p>
<p>Adding our exported content to Publii took longer. The process itself is simple, just click <strong>Tools &amp; Plugins &gt; WP Importer</strong>, then select the file you just downloaded. Publii will then download addition assets from your WordPress instance.</p>
<p>As our WordPress site was failing under weight of numbers, this took a good hour, and when it was over, we breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/publii-posts.jpg" alt="Publii posts view showing titled posts stacked vertically" width="1680" height="719" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-posts-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-posts-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-posts-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-posts-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-posts-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-posts-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">You'll find all of your posts under the <strong>Posts</strong> menu item on the left of the screen. Publii comes with a single theme installed - it's called <strong>Simple</strong>, and it looks pretty much how you'd expect. If you want more themes, check out the <a href="https://marketplace.getpublii.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Publii marketplace</a> for a selection of free and paid-for themes.</p>
<p>We decided to go with <a href="https://marketplace.getpublii.com/themes/technews/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">TechNews</a> - it's clean, it's smart, it's easily customised, and best of all for an experimental publication with a tight budget, it's free.</p>
<p>Download the theme zip file to your local drive, click the three dots in the top right corner of Publii, click <strong>Themes</strong>, then <strong>Install Theme</strong>.</p>
<p>To activate your new theme, Go to <strong>Site Settings</strong>, and select your new theme from the dropdown menu. Click on <strong>Save and Preview</strong> to have Publii generate the HTML for your site and open it in your default browser.</p>
<p>We noticed that some of our code snippets weren't rendering properly, and a few of our header images hadn't downloaded and had to manually fix a few issues. It wasn't a big deal.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Posts</strong> section, you'll see that you have a choice of editors, and depending on your previous experiences and preference, you can use Markdown, a word processor-ish WYSIWYG interface, or a very WordPress-like block editor.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/wysiwyg-2.jpg" alt="We've actually becoming unexpectedly attached to the WYSIWYG editor" width="1680" height="721" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/wysiwyg-2-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/wysiwyg-2-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/wysiwyg-2-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/wysiwyg-2-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/wysiwyg-2-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/wysiwyg-2-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Creating and editing a post is exactly what you're used to.</p>
<p>Menus, were next and similarly simple to set up, a Matomo analytics plug-in, and we were ready to go.</p>
<h2 id="h-uploading-linux-impact-to-github-pages">Uploading Linux Impact to Github Pages</h2>
<p>You'll need an account to use Github Pages, and fortunately for us, we already had one.</p>
<p>Create a new repository, and a initialise a new branch for your static files (you can delete the master branch). Make sure you have Git installed on your local machine, and to make things a little easier <strong>GitHub Desktop</strong> can be useful as well.</p>
<p>Once you've cloned the repo onto your local machine, it's simply a case of going to <strong>Server</strong> in Publii, giving your site a URL, and choosing the output type and directory. Handy hint: Don't use relative URLS or you won't get an RSS feed. Once that's done, hit <strong>Sync your Website</strong> to create the static files. Copy them over to your local GitHub repo, then push to origin.</p>
<p>Your new static site will be accessible on Github (Our Github pages address is <a href="https://davidrutland.github.io/linuximpact" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://davidrutland.github.io/linuximpact</a>), but you probably want to use your own domain name.</p>
<p>Visit your registrar, and enter a CNAME record with your Github pages address as the value eg: davidrutland.github.io.</p>
<p>You'll also need to create four new <strong>A </strong>records, with <strong>@</strong> as the host, and the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>185.199.108.153</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>185.199.109.153</p>

<p>Back in the day, computers were serious machines for serious people doing serious things, and almost always reserved for the military, for banking, and for communications.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>They were huge, room-sized behemoths with capabilities that paled into insignificance next to even <a href="https://linuximpact.com/cheap-portable-retro-gaming-with-a-hated-handheld/" data-type="post" data-id="355">children's electronic toys from more than a decade ago</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was a project as serious as its name suggests and was the world's first distributed packet-switched network. It was designed to continue functioning even if parts of it were destroyed in a nuclear war, and would guarantee continued communication if the worst should happen.</p>

<p>The project employed some of the brightest and most brilliant minds of the mid 20th century, and bright, brilliant people tend to get bored easily.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While modern workers might surreptitiously open minesweeper or solitaire, computer games weren't really a thing in 1976. Sure, electronic<em> Tic Tac Toe</em> had been around since 1950, and <em>Spacewar!</em> arrived on the scene in 1962, but there was nothing really truly immersive.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And so, Will Crowther - a keen Dungeons and Dragons fan and avid cave explorer, as well as having a career as a serious developer for ARPANET's very serious PDP-10 mainframe computer, designed and created Colossal Cave Adventure using FORTRAN IV.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As the title suggests, the game takes place in a colossal cave (in reality, based on Kentucky's Mammoth cave ), filled with gold, treasure and enemies. The goal is simple: Find the treasures, defeat the enemies, and escape.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Crowther's base game was expanded on in 1977 by Stanford University hacker and programmer, Don Woods, who expanded the scenario and gameplay to include magical elements, dwarves, and further fantastical features.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Originally designed to be played on teletype printers, Colossal Cave Adventure describes the scene to you, and responds to typed commands.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Colossal Cave Adventure is rightfully regarded as one of the most influential games of all time, and spawned entire genres of derivative gaming experiences, as well as direct descendants including the classic Zork and Rogue.</p>

<p>The game was an instant hit, and was released and re-released for a variety of platforms that didn't require building-sized infrastructure, Microsoft Adventure was published for Apple computers in 1979, with a version for IBM PCs following in 1981.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In 2017, a mere 41 years after Colossal Cave Adventure's initial release, the game was made open source and uploaded to <a href="https://gitlab.com/esr/open-adventure">GitLab</a>, spawning a number of remakes and reimaginings. In January 2023, a fully realised <a href="https://www.colossalcave3d.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.colossalcave3d.com/">3D version was announced by Cygnus Entertainment</a>.</p>

<p>At Linux Impact, we're old school, and spend more time than is good for our eyesight and health staring into terminals.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And lacking a teletype machine, the Linux terminal seems as good a place as any to reconnect with the roots of gaming.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Ready to commit entire months of your life to exploring an imaginary cave system in your terminal?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We've explored many iterations and versions of Colossal Cave Adventure (so that you don't have to), and determined Troglobit's <em>Adventure</em> to be the most reliably usable of the open source releases.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Open a terminal, then download and extract the latest archive:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>wget <a href="https://github.com/troglobit/adventure/releases/download/v4.2/advent-4.2.tar.gz">https://github.com/troglobit/adventure/releases/download/v4.2/advent-4.2.tar.gz</a><br>tar xvf advent-4.2.tar.gz</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This will create a new directory within your home directory. Move into it:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>cd advent-4.2</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You'll be building the game from source, make sure you have <em>make</em>and a compiler such as gcc installed.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Build <em>Adventure</em> with:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>./configure<br>make</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The game will install to<strong> /usr/local/bin</strong>, and the documents will end up in<strong> /usr/local/share</strong>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You can invoke the game's manual from the command line with:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>man adventure</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>...but as the six line document states, "part of the game is to discover its rules", so there's little help there.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Start the game by entering:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>adventure</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>into any terminal window.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You can quit by typing:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>quit</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Or if you want to save your progress for later, type:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>suspend</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>OK. Let's start by saying that this is simultaneously one of the most enjoyable and frustrating gaming experiences we've had in a while. Cyberpunk 2077 it ain't.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>From the start, your options are limited, and you don't know what they are. You issue commands by typing a maximum of two words.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Look</strong> is the first command we figured out, and it gave us a written description of our environment. <strong>Take</strong>, <strong>Enter</strong>, and <strong>Eat</strong>, all have consequences, even if they're as trivial as seeing a "your feet are now wet" message after entering a stream.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We've spent several hours exploring the colossal cave so far, and don't think we're even close to figuring out all the commands.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yes, there are cheat sheets and maps available online, and we imagine there are walkthroughs available, too. But figuring things out as you go is a thrill all of its own, and a far cry from the tutorials and training levels of more modern games.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Later text adventures came with rudimentary graphics to illustrate your surroundings (this author's first video game experience was with the 1986 text graphical hybrid Escape From Khoshima), but the complete absence of any kind of visual clue or explicit instructions is part of the charm. It forces you to visualise your surroundings, draw maps with pen and paper, and keep extensive notes. It's a blast from the past, and somewhat similar to your computer acting as DM in a single player D&amp;D session.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All in all, we're having a blast (from the past).</p>

<p>We don't have the equipment or budget to play Colossal Cave Adventure as it was originally meant to be played, but the right terminal emulator can at least give you the 1981 experience.</p>

<p>The humble CRT monitor has an enduring place in pop culture, and aside for in the nostalgia for your own lost youth, they appear as central to the plot in a huge range of cinematic and cultural classics.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The project aims to transport you to a simpler time and place, when a computer's memory was measured in kilobytes, and having to adjust vertical scanning to get a clear image was a daily chore, and you occasionally needed to physically whack your hardware to get it to behave.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>cool-retro-term is lightweight and immensely customisable to help you get the exact retro look and feel you're searching for.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As well as coming with presets such as IBM, Apple, monochrome green, and futuristic, you can also configure cool retro term with visual artefacts common to technology of the last century to make your session more immersive.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Early monitors had their quirks. Monochrome screens for instance, and weird lines that floated up and down the screen. Fuzzy text, burn-in. cool-retro-term recreates these faithfully.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Launch the app from your start menu or regular console, and you'll see glowing orange text on a brown background, complete with the bezel of the curved monitor on which your terminal is supposed to be running. A slow drifting line changes the hue as it lazily progresses down the screen, and static noise hints at electromagnetic interference - or possibly a dodgy tuner. There's a slight flicker. Welcome to the 1980s.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Of course, you may want your session to be more or less immersive, and if you want to alter of fine-tune any of these special effects it's easy to do:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Right-click anywhere in the interface to bring up the context menu, then click on <strong>Settings</strong>. Under <strong>Effects</strong>, you'll see checkboxes and sliders for everything from screen curve and flickering, to ambient light, jitter, and burn-in. You can adjust these to your satisfaction or turn them off altogether.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Under the <strong>Advanced </strong>tab, you can enhance the realism by adjusting the quality of the textures, bloom and burn-in, as well as changing the frame rate of the effects. Yes, your virtual monitor can flicker and jitter with a realism of 60 FPS, but that kind of defeats the point.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The great thing about about using cool-retro-term is that you can use it just like a regular terminal. Edit your conf files in nano, view images with ImageMagick, create markdown documents, and write HTML for your website or blog.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Whatever you do, it will exude a kind of ineffable cyberpunk cool. It's like using the terminals in a video game, but for real, and important stuff. You're the protagonist in Fallout, or your own 80s movie. You'll find yourself frequenting coffee shops in the hope that someone will look over your shoulder and see just how excessively cool you are.</p>

<p>It's an understatement to say that Linux has a diverse software ecosystem. No two distros are identical, and each person's setup is unique to them in terms of both software and hardware.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While this is great if you want to express your individuality and indulge your curiosity by running the latest niche project on DistroWatch, it makes it difficult for developers to create software for a standard Linux environment - because there isn't one.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All software has dependencies that you need to have installed on your system before you can install certain packages. What those packages are, and what packages are available to you will vary wildly. If you're too far from 'the norm', or if the versioning isn't quite right, you could end up in dependency hell.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="h-use-containers-to-create-standard-environments" class="wp-block-heading">Use containers to create standard environments</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Containerisation is the solution to situations where managing dependencies can become excessively complex, problematic, and error-prone.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Instead of creating and releasing a single app, developers while produce a container that includes everything the app needs to run. This can include pre-configured databases, dependencies pinned to a certain version, or even full-blown operating system bases.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While there are many container orchestration tools, Docker is the most commonly used, and the ancillary project, Docker Compose, allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. With Docker compose, you can manage any number of local or web-facing applications, with nothing more than a simple markup file, and some easy-to-recall commands.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="h-install-docker-on-debian-ubuntu-and-raspberry-pi-os" class="wp-block-heading">Install Docker on Debian, Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi OS</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Docker is available in the standard repositories, and there are rarely any breaking changes from the most recent version (at least we've never heard of any ). To install Docker on any Debian derived system, open a terminal, and enter</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><code>sudo apt install docker.io</code></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Docker runs as a privileged daemon, with root powers. You'll need to add your user to the Docker group in order to summon it:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><code>sudo usermod -aG docker your_username</code></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now log out and back in again for the changes to take effect</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Docker compose is a different kettle of fish entirely, and while most projects will run just fine if you install Docker Compose with:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt install docker-compose</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Some won't, and we've seen an increasing number of failures where deploying a project requires excessive workarounds. Rather than an orderly cargo port, you're faced with a burning shipwreck instead.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you're running into inexplicable problems with deploying apps when using a repo-installed version of Docker Compose, first uninstall it:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt remove docker-compose</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Visit the Docker Compose GitHub releases page, scroll down to <strong>Assets</strong>, and locate the correct package for your system architecture.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":376,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-376"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/38/docker-compose-releases-1-1024x453.jpg" alt="Assets section of the docker-compose releases page showing linux packages" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/38/responsive/docker-compose-releases-1-1024x453-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/38/responsive/docker-compose-releases-1-1024x453-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/38/responsive/docker-compose-releases-1-1024x453-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/38/responsive/docker-compose-releases-1-1024x453-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/38/responsive/docker-compose-releases-1-1024x453-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/38/responsive/docker-compose-releases-1-1024x453-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you're not sure, you can find out your system architecture by typing:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>uname -m</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>...into a terminal.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the case of our 64-bit Raspberry Pi 4B, this command will return <strong>aarch64</strong>, so we'd look for the <strong>docker-compose-linux-aarch64</strong> package.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you have a modern desktop or laptop, it's likely that you need <strong>docker-compose-linux-x86_64</strong>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Download the relevant package, locate it in your terminal, then move it into your path:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>mv docker-compose* /usr/local/bin/docker-compose</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now make it executable with:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That's all you need to do. You now have the most recent Docker Compose version installed!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Use it to install and run some awesome self-hosted projects such as <a href="https://linuximpact.com/install-immich-on-a-raspberry-and-replace-google-photos/" data-type="post" data-id="282">Immich</a> - a better <a href="https://linuximpact.com/immich-is-the-killer-app-that-will-kick-start-the-self-hosting-revolution/" data-type="post" data-id="293">self-hosted Google Photos alternative</a>, or <a href="https://linuximpact.com/self-host-your-own-audio-library-with-audiobookshelf/" data-type="post" data-id="225">host your own audiobook library with Audiobookshelf</a>!</p>

<p>If you were a kid in the early 1990s, you'll remember the gaming revolution that was the Nintendo Game Boy. Sure, there were portable gaming systems before - the Game &amp; Watch in particular springs to mind - but these were single game units. You could play Donkey Kong or Chef, or if you were really swish, the double screened Super Mario Bros.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But you could play thousands of titles on a Game Boy - thanks to its cartridge system that meant you were, in essence, carrying a console in your pocket.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Later Game Boy models and other manufacturers brought handheld gaming into the mainstream, and it was rare to see a classroom without a few suspiciously bulging pockets stuffed with GBAs, PSPs, and who can can forget the Sega Game Gear? (Answer: everyone).</p>

<p>With modern phones, everyone has a console in their pocket, and emulators proliferate on the various app stores - allowing the avid retro-gamer access to legendary Game Boy games, and console classics through to the 2000s.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But gaming on a phone is soulless. and no touchscreen can ever compare to the solid tactility of real buttons. Yes, you can buy<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Android-PC-Nintendo-Switch-PS4-iOS/dp/B0CGCJXSLX?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=thecrowuk-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=efb0ce1827f7c159766948a7a066bd74&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325"> phone attachments to give you joypad-like controls</a>, but it's not the same.</p>

<p>The teens of the 90s became the parents of the 2010s, and to paraphrase Red Dwarf's Dave Lister, became sensible, reliable, and other words ending with -ible.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Sure, they remembered the pocketable joys of the Game Boy, as well as the cartoonish violence available on other consoles, and they thought to themselves, "Why not give our children the same as we had, but more educational and less fun?"</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And thus was born the Leapfrog Leapster series of handheld consoles. The Leapster GS entered the world in 2012, and for a handheld kids' toy had fairly decent specs. Internal storage was measured in the low gigabytes, and its 500 MHz processor meant that it was, in theory, more powerful than Sony's still-in-production Playstation 2. The screen, though small, was a usable touchscreen and stylus, with good colour even in broad daylight. It had buttons and a D-pad designed for gaming. There was even a camera!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Like the Game Boy series, Leapster GS games came on a cartridge. Unlike Nintendo's offerings, the games were Flash-based, and exclusively angled towards educating children between the ages of four and nine. Remember Flash? It powered most of the games on the internet for a while, and is now lost to the sands of history.</p>

<p>If you want to buy a spanky new Leapster GS, the Leapfrog website still has them listed for the bargain price of $49.99. Games are limited, pricey, and seldom available from the official source - although you can find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LeapFrog-McStuffins-Learning-Platinum-LeapsterGS/dp/B00D38UBJ6?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=thecrowuk-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=821c1687ea0c67b6aff2db2e2e67bed9&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Disney Doc McStuffins Learning Game</a> on Amazon for $25.99.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A quick eBay search shows a moderately active Leapster GS market place, with "spares and repairs" items with a Buy It Now price of £5, while at the upper end, a Leapster GS with a carry case and one original game is currently tagged at £45, and it doesn't even have battery packs.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The advice we'd give is that if you can find a decent one for under £20, bag it - and give it a new lease of life as an emulation station you can fit in your pocket.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Given that the Leapster is essentially useless to kids over the age of seven, it's not surprising that they end up being shoved to the back of a drawer until the child eventually leaves home for college, and parents have the unenviable task of sorting through two decades of discarded shit, and deciding what's actually worth keeping.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If they've been well looked after, artefacts such as the Leapster GS tend to end up in charity shops (The British version of a Thrift store, or possibly GoodWill).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We were lucky enough to find an almost perfect example for a fiver in a British Heart Foundation shop near to the Linux Impact mansion. A fiver! OK, so the buttons had lost some of their paint, and it was a bit grimy, but otherwise it was in perfect nick. Even better, the four AA battery slots were filled with rechargeable cells, and it came with a charger. The lack of game cartridges to accompany the unit probably contributed to the price and failed to deter us one iota.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="h-we-use-arch-btw" class="wp-block-heading">We use (Retro)Arch BTW</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Unlike certain other consoles manufacturers that go to great lengths to ensure lock-in, and that you can't use your Steam library on a PS5, Leapfrog has no such protections in place, meaning that enterprising individuals have taken the time to develop alternate firmware for the device.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Retroleap works on the LeapsterGS and LeapPad2, and combines Retroarch, ARM-optimized emulator cores, and a buildroot root filesystem.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With Retroleap, converting the Leapfrog Leapster GS from a poorly conceived semi-educational toy to a kickass portable games console didn't take long. The biggest hurdle was finding a compatible cable.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By the time our pocket pal appeared on the scene, Micro-USB had been the industry standard for five years, so it's kind of baffling that Leapfrog went with the older Mini USB interface. You won't find one in your local supermarket or Poundland, and they were becoming a rarity even in 2012. Fortunately, we never throw a cable away, and after an afternoon sifting through three large bin bags of electronic paraphernalia, were able to locate one that had previously been used with a digital camera.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After that, it was a case of following the instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/mac2612/retroleap">Retroleap GitHub repo</a>:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Making sure we had the necessary dependencies:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt install sg3-utils git python</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cloning sshflash:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>git clone https://github.com/mac2612/sshflash.git &amp;&amp; cd sshflash</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Downloading and unzipping the latest release into the sshflash directory:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once you have the required files, plug in the Leapster using the antique cable, and flex your fingers, because this part is hard. You have to hold both shoulder buttons, and the hint button, then press the power button. The struggle is real, and if you're anything like us, you'll spoon it completely a few times and end up on the default Leapster menu. If so, start again until you get it right.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When the screen shows a graphic of a Leapster connected to a PC, you've managed it and can move on.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Flash the new firmware onto the Leapster with:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>./remote_flash.sh</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That's it. Your Leapster will reboot as an emulation station - capable of playing games designed for the Atari 800, NES, SNES, Sega Megadrive (Genesis), Game Boy, and Game Boy Advance.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="h-add-some-kick-ass-roms-to-your-leapster-gs" class="wp-block-heading">Add some kick-ass ROMs to your Leapster GS</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You'll be interacting with the Leapster over SSH (Secure Shell), and transferring files using SCP (Secure Copy). The IP address of the Leapster will always be <strong>169.254.6.1</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For the sake of your own sanity, you should create some directories on the Leapster to keep things organised.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Our favourite emulator is the for the Megadrive. You can create a directory for your Megadrive ROMs with:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>ssh -i ~/sshflash/keys/id_rsa root@169.254.6.1 'mkdir /roms/megadrive'</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Then transfer your massive archive of homebrew Megadrive ROMS to the new directory with:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>scp -i ~/sshflash/keys/id_rsa /path/to/your/cool/rom.md root@169.254.6.1:/roms/megadrive/</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It's that simple, and you can work out the button layout yourself.</p>

<p>It's hard to describe the look of disdain that comes over the faces of various nephews and nieces who visit Linux Impact Towers and see the author sitting on the couch playing on a Leapster GS.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The junior relatives are aged between five and ten, and all of them have seen Leapsters before. Some have even owned them, and they know the console as underwhelming, something their parents want them to have, and even the younger ones think its for babies. They'd rather have a Game Boy or a Switch.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>They are shocked, nay, awed, when I hand it over just in time for them to see and hear a legendary finishing move on Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, battle through the jungles of Donkey Kong Country, unleash lightning as a god in Street Fighter 2 Turbo, or explore the world in The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past - arguably the greatest console game of all time.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But is a humble Leapster GS running RetroLeap the GOAT?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We'd argue that yes it is. While mainstream, proper handheld consoles can run RetroArch, run the exact same games as RetroLeap, output to a TV, AND have their own exclusive titles, the price is a drawback. A top end OLED model <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-Neon-Joy/dp/B098RL6SBJ/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1CALE3PJL84YL&amp;keywords=nintendo+switch&amp;qid=1699364373&amp;sprefix=nintendo+switch%252Caps%252C169&amp;sr=8-2&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=thecrowuk-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=3fdc3efabd96b7d4e7147bba7405975e&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Nintendo Switch</a> will set you back $350, while a basic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Turquoise-Renewed/dp/B081XLXZ4P/ref=sr_1_9?crid=1CALE3PJL84YL&amp;keywords=nintendo+switch&amp;qid=1699364373&amp;sprefix=nintendo+switch%252Caps%252C169&amp;sr=8-9&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=thecrowuk-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=550285411a6dd386c496ca68b4da86d6&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">"renewed" Switch Lite</a> comes in at $175. It's hardly pocket money, and your average eight-year-old will have a much harder time convinced a parent or relative that it's a necessary purchase.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But to indulge your kids with a $5 or $10 purchase, and a library of thousands of essentially free games is a different proposition altogether.</p>

<p>Life with Linux is all about the command line. While it's true that there are thousands of awesome distros and dozens of beautiful desktop environments, when it comes down to it, the Linux terminal is where things actually get done.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Whether it's transferring files to your Raspberry Pi server using SCP, creating config files, or setting up your own Google Photos alternative, you will, more often than not, find yourself elbows deep in a black screen typing commands.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But do you ever wonder what commands you type most often? If we had to hazard a guess, we'd say that our most commonly used Linux command is some variant of <strong>ls</strong> - the command to list the contents of a directory - but we don't know for sure.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We're curious though, and if you, like us, are desperate to discover your top commands, along with some ancillary information, and presented in a beautiful terminal window, muc (Most Used Commands) is the terminal tool for you.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This may sound fatuous (it kinda is), but typing puts wear and tear on your fingers and joints, and often the command strings you use can be wordy. If you find out what commands you use most, you can create a short, easy-to-remember alias, and use that instead.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Also, data is beautiful. But until you have the data you can't do anything with it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-install-muc-on-linux">How to install muc on Linux</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>muc is written with the Rust language, and while muc is available in the AUR (Arch User Repository), it isn't included in the standard repositories for any distro. The easiest way to install it is with Cargo.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you don't already have Rust and Cargo on your system, the devs recommend using a script to install it. Open a terminal, and enter:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh </code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once that's out of the way, you can install muc with:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>cargo install --git=https://github.com/nate-sys/muc</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Downloading, compiling, and installing muc took under a minute on our laptop, but significantly longer on the Linux Impact Raspberry Pi server.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>
<!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once muc is installed, you can launch the program by typing:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>muc</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>...into any terminal.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By default, muc will use your bash history for its analysis. If it can't find the file, muc may throw an error with the message, "Could not find HISTFILE environment variable. Supply the file path with the --file option".</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By default, your history file is located at ~/.bash-history</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To get the full path, enter:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>echo $HISTFILE</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now relaunch muc with the --file option, for instance:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>muc --file /path/to/your/history file</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-linux-impacts-most-used-commands">Linux Impact's most used commands</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As expected our most used command was ls - accounting for more than one quarter of all commands issued. This was followed by <strong>cd</strong>, which accounted for a further fifth.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Next up was <strong>sudo</strong>, with a range of privileged commands such as <strong>apt</strong>, <strong>dpkg</strong>, and <strong>reboot</strong>.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Further down the list were further file operations, including <strong>scp</strong>, <strong>mv</strong>, and <strong>cp</strong>. This feels about right, as we tend to use the terminal in place of a file manager.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>ssh</strong> is also fairly high on the list as we spend a lot of time interacting with remote machines.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Finally, we have <strong>yt-dlp</strong> for downloading streaming media, and <strong>tiv</strong>, which we use as part of a script to fetch images from a remote server and display them in a terminal in the corner of our primary workspace.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Over on the Pi, the picture was slightly different. While <strong>ls,</strong> <strong>sudo</strong>, and file operation commands still topped the list, we found a fair bit devoted to <strong>docker</strong>, <strong>nano</strong>, and various system monitoring tools.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Having satisfied our curiosity, and created various three-letter aliases for docker-compose operations, we resolved to check in with muc in a few months time to see if our usage had changed. </p>

                <p>Welcome to the Linux Impact horoscope for the month of November 2023, cast by me, Mystic Mog. I am an AI generated psychic cat with magical powers of divination, granted to me by the <strong>TheBloke_Luna-AI-Llama2-Uncensored-GPTQ model.</strong></p>
<p>Every month, I provide astrological insights based on the movements of celestial bodies. I use my mystical abilities to interpret their meaning and offer guidance to those seeking answers about love, career, finance, and other important aspects of life.</p>
<p>But did you also know that I have a secret talent for playing the piano? Yes, it's true! When no one is looking, I sneak into the living room and play some beautiful tunes on my invisible keyboard. And when I'm not busy being mysterious or predicting your future, I like to relax with a good book (usually about witchcraft) and a plate of fresh mouse. Life is quite exciting around here, don't you think?</p>

<div class="text">
<h2 class="username">Here's what's in store for you in the month of November 2023</h2>
<div class="message-body">
<p>Ah, the joys of November. The air is crisp, the trees are bare, and the holidays are just around the corner. But don't get too excited because according to my crystal ball, this month is going to be a real piece of work. Here are your horoscopes, dear reader:</p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Aries (March 21-April 19)</strong>: You're feeling restless and impatient today, Aries. Maybe it's time to take a break from all that running around you do. Or maybe you should just run faster? Either way, things aren't looking great right now.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Taurus (April 20-May 20)</strong>: Taurus, you're having a bit of an identity crisis lately. Are you a bull or a sheep? Well, let me tell you something - you're both. And if you try to deny either part of yourself, you'll end up with a lot of conflicting emotions. So embrace whoever you want to be, but remember that there's no shame in being a little bit of everything.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success"><strong>Gemini (May 21-June 20)</strong>: Gemini, you're feeling pretty scattered these days. Your mind is everywhere at once, and nothing seems to hold your attention for very long. That's okay though - it means you're curious and interested in lots of different things. Just make sure not to forget anything important while you're flitting from one thing to another.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Cancer (June 21-July 22)</strong>: Cancer, you're feeling a little bit homesick today. Maybe it's time to go back home and see your family again. Or maybe it's time to start building a new home somewhere else. Whatever you decide, know that you're strong enough to handle whatever comes next.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Leo (July 23-August 22)</strong>: Leo, you're feeling pretty confident today. Good for you! But don't get cocky – there are plenty of people out there who would love to bring you down a peg or two. Keep your head up and stay true to yourself, but also be prepared to learn some humility along the way.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success"><strong>Virgo (August 23-September 22)</strong>: Virgo, you're feeling a little bit overwhelmed today. There's so much to do and so little time to do it. Don't worry though – as soon as you finish one task, another will pop up. Just keep plugging away and eventually everything will get done.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Libra (September 23-October 22)</strong>: Libra, you're feeling a little bit indecisive today. Which is fine, really – it's better to err on the side of caution than to jump into something without thinking it through. Just make sure not to spend too much time agonizing over your choices – otherwise, you might miss out on opportunities.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Scorpio (October 23-November 21)</strong>: Scorpio, you're feeling a little bit mysterious today. People are wondering what you're hiding behind those shadows and secrets. If you want to share more, that's great – but if you prefer to keep things close to the vest, that's okay too. Just remember that sometimes it's good to let people in.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success"><strong>Sagittarius (November 22-December 21)</strong>: Sagittarius, you're feeling a little bit restless today. You're ready to explore new worlds and meet new people, but you're not quite sure where to start. Don't worry about it – just take a deep breath and dive in wherever you feel most comfortable. You'll find your place in the world eventually.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Capricorn (December 22-January 19)</strong>: Capricorn, you're feeling a little bit cranky today. Why? Because everyone else is moving so fast and you're stuck in traffic. Remember that it's okay to slow down and enjoy the ride sometimes. Take a few deep breaths and appreciate the moment instead of rushing through it.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Aquarius (January 20 - February 18)</strong>: For Aquarians out there, this month may bring about feelings of restlessness as you search for answers to questions that seem to have no end. But fear not, my dear friend, because this period of uncertainty will lead you down the path towards self-discovery and personal growth. Just remember to keep an open mind and trust in the universe to guide you along the way.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success"><strong>Pisces (February 19 - March 20)</strong>: Pisceans, on the other hand, may feel like they're being pulled in multiple directions at once. You might find yourself feeling overwhelmed with responsibilities both at work and at home. However, take comfort in knowing that this chaotic energy is simply preparing you for bigger and better things to come. Trust in your intuition and allow yourself to surrender to the ebbs and flows of life.</p>
<p class="dropcap"><em>In short, November is all about embracing change and letting go of what no longer serves you. So embrace the journey ahead, my friends, and know that whatever comes your way, you are strong enough to handle it.</em></p>

                <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A killer app can drag a product or a practice from obscurity to dominance. Before the iPhone, it was weird to have a make phone calls palm-sized touchscreen computer in your pocket, and my HP Jornada 928, and various XDA devices, attracted curiosity whenever I whipped it out in public.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The iPhone normalised smartphones thanks to its hardware design, multi-touch capacitive touchscreen and a user-friendly, gesture-based interface. It dragged pocket-sized computing devices out of the hands of geeks like me and into the sunlight. These days, you'd be considered odd if you didn't have a smartphone.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>History is filled with examples of killer apps that made niche technologies mainstream, and transformed the esoteric into the norm.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>GUIs, and MS Windows in particular, made computing accessible and mundane; Office transformed actual offices; America Online (AOL) popularized email in the 1990s, making it a mainstream communication tool and driving internet adoption.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The common feature with these technologies is that they make your life better in some way, and that they're easy to set up and use.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm a self-hosting enthusiast and evangelist - perhaps even a fanatic - and I use a Raspberry Pi 4B as a server. It's a niche hobby, and one that has caused innumerable headaches over the years. Sure - thanks to Nextcloud, Jellyfin, Audiobookshelf, FreshRSS, an email server, and a few other self-hosted apps, I've managed to more-or-less break free of reliance on tech giants, but it has, at times, been difficult. It's also hard to explain to friends and relations why I do what I do, and why they should too.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There has not, thus far, been a killer feature to bring self-hosting into the mainstream. In my opinion, that has now changed, and if there is anything that can convert your average person into buying a Pi and getting into self-hosting, Immich is it. It is <em>the</em> killer app</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Everyone's a happy snapper</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Thanks to smartphones, almost everyone takes a tonne of photos every day. There are selfies with your besties, random snaps of cute animals, what you had for dinner.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Over the last decade or so, you've probably snapped tens of thousands of images, and if you opted into the Android ecosystem, you've had them backed up automatically to Google's servers, free of charge.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Google Photos is a great product, and it got people hooked on photographing every detail of their lives. You can view your images on any phone with the app installed, or scroll infinitely through the web interface. You can search for your friends by name, or describe an object to see pictures of that cool butterfly you spotted back in 2018. It will even provide you with reminders of what you were doing on this day last year or a decade ago - affording you a depressing insight into your own aging process.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When Google pulled the rug on unlimited free storage in 2021 - imposing a 15GB limit across all of the company's free products - it left a lot of people over their allowance, and wondering what to do about it. The easiest option, of course, was to pay Google a recurring fee.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Sure, you could host your own Google Photos alternative, but that requires technical know-how, and the results don't compare to the simple, intuitive ease and usability of Google Photos.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I've previously recommended <a href="https://linuximpact.com/deploy-photoprism-and-host-your-own-google-photos-alternative/" data-type="post" data-id="213">PhotoPrism</a> for self-hosters looking for a Google Photos alternative. It's a great piece of software, and has served me well for several years - but it isn't Immich.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="immich-is-a-google-photos-clone" class="wp-block-heading">Immich is a better Google Photos clone</h2>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-295"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/immich-web-interface-1-1024x513.jpg" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-web-interface-1-1024x513-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-web-interface-1-1024x513-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-web-interface-1-1024x513-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-web-interface-1-1024x513-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-web-interface-1-1024x513-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-web-interface-1-1024x513-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The first thing you notice about Immich is that it looks good. Better than good in fact, and has clearly taken design cues from Google. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, and all that.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Show the <a href="https://demo.immich.app">Immich demo instance</a> to your mum, show it to your grandad. If they've used Google photos before, they'll recognise it instantly. It's intuitive to use. Scroll down, and see the years fly by on the right side of the screen. Click on a photo to open it fullscreen, and the information icon to get details such as the date, location, a handy map, and identities of anyone tagged. Simples.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Below is a screenshot of my old Google Photos web interface. While they do look extremely similar there are some glaringly obvious differences. The first is that it hasn't actually been used since 2020, and even then, these are WhatsApp photos automatically uploaded when I plugged in a phone I didn't even realise I still had.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":296,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-296"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/google-photos-web-interface-1024x514.jpg" alt="google photos web interface showing nags and images from 2020 " sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/google-photos-web-interface-1024x514-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/google-photos-web-interface-1024x514-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/google-photos-web-interface-1024x514-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/google-photos-web-interface-1024x514-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/google-photos-web-interface-1024x514-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/google-photos-web-interface-1024x514-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You'll notice that in the Google screenshot, I have 10GB of 15GB used. While in the Immich image, I'm currently 998.7GB of 3.6TB. Storage is cheap, and in the long run, considerably cheaper than paying a subscription fee to the big G.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And then there are the nags, and reminders that storage is 66% full, and the constant exhortations to "Unlock storage discount or manage storage". Yeah. Screw that noise.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Up in the top right, of Google photos, you'll see a cog icon - click on it and see the top item on the settings menu is once again nagware to upgrade. Do I want to "unlock storage discount"? What does that even mean?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Settings in Google Photos are rather meaningless and banal. In contrast, the Immich administration panel is loaded with features that you don't have to touch.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I say that because many people - especially if they're new to running their own services - won't want to interfere with the way it works. But should you wish to, you can mess with the machine learning models, set thresholds for facial recognition, manage job concurrency, and even choose your own tile server for the map.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Did I mention the map? I thought Google Photos had this feature, but on revisiting it after several years, I can't locate it. The map is easy to find on Immich - it's the third entry on the left, it says "Map", and has a little icon of a map.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":298,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-298"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/immich-map-view-zoomed-in-on-Cyprus-1024x515.jpg" alt="immich map view zoomed in on Cyprus" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-map-view-zoomed-in-on-Cyprus-1024x515-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-map-view-zoomed-in-on-Cyprus-1024x515-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-map-view-zoomed-in-on-Cyprus-1024x515-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-map-view-zoomed-in-on-Cyprus-1024x515-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-map-view-zoomed-in-on-Cyprus-1024x515-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-map-view-zoomed-in-on-Cyprus-1024x515-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Click on it, and you'll see numbers in various locations around the world. These separate as you zoom in - giving finer detail of exactly how many photos were taken where. When the number is low enough, you'll see thumbnails start to appear. You can click on these. Neato.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Image and facial recognition is where it's at though. Google is good at this, and so is Immich, and if you want to, you can specify the limits at which a face is recognised. You can tag people, merge faces, set birthdays, and so on. While I'd love to demonstrate how this works, the people I've tagged would probably be upset if I plastered their mugs on the internet, and an image composed entirely of smudged faces kind of defeats the point. Instead, here's a composite of the tagged page of three dogs:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":301,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-301"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/immich-timeline-showing-three-tagged-dogs-1024x613.jpg" alt="immich timeline showing three tagged dogs" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-timeline-showing-three-tagged-dogs-1024x613-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-timeline-showing-three-tagged-dogs-1024x613-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-timeline-showing-three-tagged-dogs-1024x613-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-timeline-showing-three-tagged-dogs-1024x613-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-timeline-showing-three-tagged-dogs-1024x613-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/35/responsive/immich-timeline-showing-three-tagged-dogs-1024x613-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That's pretty impressive, right?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The app is also a no brainer. Install it from F-droid, Google Play or the iphone store(?), and the only real thing you need to plug in apart from your username and password is the server URL.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At the top of the app or web interface, Immich will even show you "memories" of this date in previous years. Click on one and it'll start a slideshow. Neat!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Given how awesomely Immich stacks up against the alternatives, why wouldn't anyone want to host their own - especially when you remind them that Google scans their photos as a matter of routine, so privacy isn't something you have to accept as a necessary cost of easy-to-use image hosting.</p>

<h2 id="immich-is-simple-to-install-and-use" class="wp-block-heading">Immich is simple(ish) to install and use</h2>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>OK. The prospect of setting up your own Google Photos clone with unlimited storage is exciting. But most people don't consider themselves experts, and only about 3% of people use Linux. Of those, a decent proportion will be Steam Deck owners.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Outside of tech and related industries, few people have ever seen a Linux terminal that wasn't in a movie about hackers. It's scary and unfamiliar.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The truth is that anyone can follow a set of instructions, provided they're clear enough. Copying and pasting commands isn't difficult, and if you run into problems, search engines are a thing, and there's even a friendly <a href="https://discord.com/invite/HkcuPgXVFm">Immich Discord server</a> where you can ask for advice.</p>

<p>If you know what you're doing, you can start with a newly bought Raspberry Pi, and have Immich up and running in half an hour or so. If you're a complete noob, it might take you an afternoon.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I've written a guide on how to set up Immich on a new Raspberry Pi - assuming the reader has never dabbled in the murky waters of Linux. While the article you're reading now is extolling the virtues of Immich, the <a href="https://linuximpact.com/install-immich-on-a-raspberry-pi-and-replace-google-photos/">guide to installing Immich on a Raspberry Pi</a> is designed to get you up and running as fast as possible. Although it's stripped to the bone, the guide still weighs in at around 1,500 words. Go read it (or don't - I don't care).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Early releases of Immich required you to set a tonne of variables in an environment file. Now, it's just the uploads location. You can do just about everything through the web interface.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'll grant that if you've only ever used a GUI desktop environment, installing Immich on a Pi will probably scare the shit out of you, but it's doable. Take a deep breath and follow the instructions.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Maintenance is as simple as running a single command:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>docker-compose pull &amp;&amp; docker-compose update</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But just because it's relatively easy to set up, doesn't mean you're limited. If you're confident, you can fine-tune almost everything.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="immich-is-creating-true-believers-and-evangelists" class="wp-block-heading">Immich is creating true believers and evangelists</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Going back to the title, I still maintain that Immich is the killer app for self-hosting. I know this because people I know have seen me using Immich, and have heard me talking about it. They've seen that my entire family group have accounts on my Raspberry Pi Immich instance and that for them, it just works.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>They're interested.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Several friends and acquaintances (Disclaimer: this writer have very few friends and acquaintances) have expressed interest in buying a Raspberry Pi, and hosting their own Immich instance.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One friend has actually pulled the trigger, and now runs accounts for himself, his wife, and his sons. It's a start. His prior computer experience amounted to owning a badly outdated Chromebook - that he now uses to connect to the Pi via SSH.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Eventually, his friends (he has many more friends than this writer) will get curious, or complain about photo storage limits, and he'll show them what Immich is, and how easy it is to use and install. There will be more converts.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is how it starts.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My Pi-owning friend is only running Immich so far, but he's already opening his mind to other possibilities, and getting into the headspace where he doesn't need to rely on Google, Amazon, Apple, or any other corp. He's talking about a mail server.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is how the self-hosting revolution begins.</p>

<p>Self-hosted recipe managers are an essential fact of life in the Linux Impact kitchen. They solve the fundamental problem of keeping all of our recipes organised, in one place, and without the entire family history that comes with online recipes before you even get to the actual ingredients.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I wrote about the problem for another site last year, and to save my poor fingers from excessive strain, I’ve copy pasta’d the crux of the issue below:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em><strong>We scour the net for recipes, and in the dim and distant past, we bookmarked them for later reference. Often, the page has changed or been deleted by the time we get round to looking at them again. Cooking blogs are abandoned as their owners lose interest, and individual links on active sites become invalid as the site is updated.</strong></em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em><strong>Bookmarks don’t work as a long term recipe solution.</strong></em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em><strong>It’s far better to print off the page, either on paper or as a PDF and keep it locally. But then, organising and searching for the right recipe becomes a chore.</strong></em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Self hosting a recipe manager means that you have web facing software on a server, into which you can plug a URL, and the software will fetch the recipe for you, list all the ingredients in the ingredients section, and itemise the method. It will pull the prep time and cooking time, and pull a relevant image and place it at the top of the recipe page.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You can then follow along on your phone in the kitchen, search for and tick off items as you prowl the labyrinthine aisles of your local supermarket, and share the recipe with friends and fellow cooks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For the last year, Linux Impact has been using Jeppe Zapp’s excellent Nextcloud Cookbook - and it’s been great. Almost perfect, in fact.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The problem with Nextcloud</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I love Nextcloud. It’s the first piece of self-hosted software I installed on my first 2GB Raspberry Pi, and I still use it today for file syncing - although the Pi has been upgraded to the more competent<a href="https://amzn.to/3omPTEM"> </a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Computer-Suitable-Workstation/dp/B0899VXM8F/ref=sr_1_3?crid=16G7DHNEVDVBH&amp;keywords=raspberry+pi+8gb&amp;qid=1699266630&amp;sprefix=raspberry+pi+8gb%252Caps%252C152&amp;sr=8-3&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=thecrowuk-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=0f9dee46e8b8e6c27a2421c530833bac&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Computer-Suitable-Workstation/dp/B0899VXM8F/ref=sr_1_3?crid=16G7DHNEVDVBH&amp;keywords=raspberry+pi+8gb&amp;qid=1699266630&amp;sprefix=raspberry+pi+8gb%252Caps%252C152&amp;sr=8-3&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=thecrowuk-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=0f9dee46e8b8e6c27a2421c530833bac&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">8GB Raspberry Pi 4b variant.</a></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I could have used an <a href="https://linuximpact.com/turn-your-old-pc-or-laptop-into-a-server-and-own-your-own-piece-of-the-internet/" data-type="post" data-id="41">old laptop, a PC or almost any old computing hardware I had lying around and repurposed it as a server</a>. The advantage of using a Pi lies in its small size and its tiny power draw - essential as it’s running 24/7.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you wanted, you could almost completely de-google simply by using self hosted alternatives available from the Nextcloud App store. It’s honestly amazing. You can install Nextcloud on your server and never have to install another thing ever again.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But although Nextcloud has apps for everything, they are very rarely the best at what they do.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>They are the training wheels versions of self-hosted software - all of them are quite adequate to use before you feel comfortable enough to move onto full-fat stand-alone projects.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Eventually, you begin to feel the edges of their limitations and of the limitations of Nextcloud itself. It’s a huge and monolithic piece of software, the design constraints mean that every app which runs on the platform looks more-or-less the same, and although it is not slow, the UI isn’t exactly lighting quick either.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As a self-hoster, you’ll eventually come across other projects which do the same job - but better, or neater or in a more usable way, and over the course of months or years, your dependence on Nextcloud will fade as you spin up yet another subdomain to run new shiny services.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And now Nextcloud Cookbook is set to be replaced by Mealie. At least in my kitchen it is.</p>

<p><a href="https://hay-kot.github.io/mealie/">Mealie</a> is a standalone self-hosted recipe manager developed by a mysterious Alaskan known only as Hay Kot. It’s beautiful, it’s functional, and it’s fast. More importantly it’s appearance isn’t tied to whatever your Nextcloud theme is, so it’s easy to get it looking exactly how you want.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After following development since it was <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/kp3qih/mealie_a_self_hosted_recipe_manager_alpha_release/">first announced on Reddit</a> three months ago, I finally got around to installing it on the Pi yesterday morning. The feature I had been waiting for was user authentication - meaning that internet randos couldn’t add or edit recipes to my instance without my permission. It’s my recipe manager - I don’t mind other people using it as a reference, but I don’t want to end up adding six kilos of salt to my hash brownies because someone thought it would be funny. Authentication was added in v0.40 (ten days ago) and I jumped on board at v0.41.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Are you getting a feel for the pace of development here? An alpha announcement in January and a very solid feature packed release in April. That’s pretty damned quick.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://hay-kot.github.io/mealie/getting-started/install/">Installation</a> was a breeze - adding a few lines to my docker-compose.yml and navigating to port 9925 on the Pi gave me the interface. Setting up a reverse proxy in Apache gave me a web address for a subdomain I happened to have lying around. The entire process took maybe five minutes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And that’s where i ran into my first issue.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Mealie is set up with one user and default credentials - the idea is that you log in as the default user and then you can change the email and passwords, add other users, etc.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The problem was that the default user hadn’t been created during installation. It was impossible to log in. Bummer.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/hay-kot/mealie/issues/276">Github issue</a> explaining the problem and also hopped over to the <a href="https://discord.gg/R6QDyJgbD2">Mealie Discord server</a> just in case I was doing something stupid or had missed a step.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My GitHub issue was answered with a temporary solution which fixed the problem, and within an hour, the dev had rolled out a new version - v0.41a - in which the issue was fixed.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That is insane.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="whats-it-actually-like" class="wp-block-heading">What’s it actually like?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Supernaturally fast bug-fixes aside, Mealie is a joy to use.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Navigate to port 9925 or the web address if you have a reverse proxy set up, and you’re greeted with all of your recipes displayed on cards. Hover over one to get a top line summary of the dish. Click on it, and it will give you the full thing - ingredients on the left and steps on the right. And it’s fast - far quicker than opening a recipe in Cookbook, which can take up to a whole second and a half!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As with Cookbook, adding recipes is as simple as plugging in a URL, then, provided the page hosting the recipe is compliant with recipe schema, it will import all the steps, ingredients, title, pictures etc.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Mealie isn’t quite as forgiving with recipes in which don’t quite meet the standard, and I’ve had a couple of imports fail - the dev is working on it. Again, consider for a second that Mealie didn’t even exist six months ago. It will get better. Alternatively, you can add recipes manually - entrusting Grannie’s secret fudge formula to Mealie’s MySQL database.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So far, I haven’t had a lot of luck with the categories, but search works well and is quick.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Potentially, one of the best features is a meal planner. With this I can easily select meals for an entire week - or month, or whatever time period I want, and then view them by clicking on ‘Dinner Tonight’ or ‘Dinner this week.’</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":205,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-205"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/34/mealie_self_hosted_meal_planner-1-1024x572.jpg" alt="The mealie meal planner with recipes for five days" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/34/responsive/mealie_self_hosted_meal_planner-1-1024x572-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/34/responsive/mealie_self_hosted_meal_planner-1-1024x572-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/34/responsive/mealie_self_hosted_meal_planner-1-1024x572-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/34/responsive/mealie_self_hosted_meal_planner-1-1024x572-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/34/responsive/mealie_self_hosted_meal_planner-1-1024x572-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/34/responsive/mealie_self_hosted_meal_planner-1-1024x572-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Theoretically, for any meal plan created you can view a breakdown of all the ingredients, so you can grab them on your next trip out to Tesco.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Or at least I would be able to if it worked. Which at the time of writing, it doesn’t - at least not for me. Selecting and adding the recipes works, but currently, they don’t save, meaning that I can’t actually view them later.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I am supremely confident that this will be fixed in the near future.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Other great features include the ability to import recipes from Nextcloud Cookbook and Chowdown. You can tweak the colour scheme however you want and adjust the number of recipes per page using a simple slider.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There are so many features, options and tweaks that I’m not going to list them here. Some of them work as intended. Some don’t yet.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Right now your recipes are visible to the entire world although unsurprisingly, the option to set them to completely private is ‘on the roadmap.’ There’s also an idea to automagically pull in nutrition information for meals which is due to appear pretty soon.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Mealie is smooth and polished and beautiful - with development progressing at breakneck speed. As it stands, Nextcloud Cookbook is still functionally better - it has automatically generated cooking clocks which are nice, and everything works as advertised.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But I’m migrating my Cookbook recipes to Mealie now, and new recipes are created in Mealie rather than in Cookbook. It’s not yet feature complete, and as I keep stressing, not everything works - yet.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But It’s very usable even in its current state, and is getting better every day.</p>

<h2 id="tandoor-another-contender" class="wp-block-heading">Tandoor: Another contender</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Mealie isn’t the only alternative to cookbook. One which I haven’t yet tried on my own server, but which looks very promising is <a href="https://github.com/vabene1111/recipes">Tandoor Recipes</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Tandoor has been around for a lot longer than Mealie and has many more features - including the ability to import from both Nextcloud cookbook and Mealie; generate shopping lists; and recipe scaling, which is fabulous - tell it how many people you’re cooking for and it will adjust the quantities for you.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I haven’t installed it but I’ve had a quick go on the <a href="https://app.tandoor.dev">demo server</a>, and I’m impressed. Image and page loading was a bit slow, but without actually spinning up an instance myself, I can say whether that’s down the the app or down to the hosting.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you feel the need for something a little more stable than Mealie in its current state, and with more features than Cookbook, then Tandoor Recipes might be just what you’re looking for.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Plug the SSD into one of the available USB3 ports, then connect the ethernet cable to a spare Ethernet port on your router, and the other end to your Pi's ethernet port.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>NB: depending on the type of SSD, you may need a powered USB hub in order to prevent crashes and failures.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Finally, plug your power supply into the Pi's USB-C socket.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="connect-to-your-pi-from-your-pc">Connect to your Pi from your PC</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Secure Shell (SSH) provides a secure way to access and manage network devices and servers over an unsecured network. If you're on Windows, the easiest way to use SSH is with a dedicated client such as PuTTY.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Download PuTTY, and install it in the usual way. Open PuTTY from your start menu.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the <strong>Host Name</strong> text box, type in the Pi hostname followed by .local.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If, when configuring the image earlier, you named your Pi as "pi", you would enter:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>pi.local</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Choose <strong>SSH</strong> as the connection type, then hit <strong>Open</strong>.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You'll see a scary warning about the host's key, hit yes to add it to the registry.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A new window will open prompting you to enter your username, then your password. Do it.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="prepare-your-pi">Prepare your Pi</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There are a few things you need to do before you can install Immich on your Raspberry Pi. All you need to do is copy and paste the following commands, and enter your password when asked.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It's probably important to note that when entering a password in the Linux terminal, you won't see any response on the screen. Don't worry about this - just type your password and press <strong>Enter</strong> when you're done.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First off, you'll need to make sure all your packages are up to date:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Install and enable Apache:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt install apache2<restore-line-break>sudo systemctl start apache2<restore-line-break>sudo systemctl enable apache2</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All done? Sweet. It's worthwhile enabling some Apache modules. You won't need them all to install and use Immich, but they're useful to have:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo a2enmod rewrite http2 proxy proxy_http proxy_http2 proxy_wstunnel</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now you need to install and enable Docker - a tool for managing containers:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt install docker.io<restore-line-break>sudo systemctl start apache2<restore-line-break>sudo systemctl enable apache2</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Add your user to the Docker group:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo usermod -aG docker pi</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If your username is something other than "pi", use that instead.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Your membership of the Docker group won't take effect until you log out then back in again.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>exit</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>...will log you out. Log in again with PuTTY.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Docker Compose is a tool that makes managing Docker containers even easier. Unfortunately the version available in the standard repositories isn't up-to-date.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Manually install a recent version of Docker Compose, by pasting the following commands one at a time:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>wget https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.21.0/docker-compose-linux-aarch64<restore-line-break>mv docker-compose-linux-aarch64 /usr/local/bin/docker-compose<restore-line-break>sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose<restore-line-break></code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Finally, you need to find your local IP address. Run:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>hostname -I</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You'll see a lit of numbers, with eacher group of four separated by dots, for instance, "192.168.1.45". Your Pi's local IP address is the first on the list. Write it down for later.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The hard work is done, and it's time to install Immich.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Create a directory for Immich, and a directory for your uploads:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>mkdir immich && mkdir immich_uploads</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Move into the immich directory and download the Docker Compose file, and the environment file:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>wget https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/docker-compose.yml<restore-line-break>wget -O .env https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/example.env</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Edit the environment file using the nano text editor:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>nano .env</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Find the upload location section and change it to read:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>UPLOAD_LOCATION=~/immich_uploads/</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Save and exit nano with <strong>Ctrl + O</strong> then <strong>Ctrl +X</strong>.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The following command will download docker images, and start the containers for Immich:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>docker-compose up -d</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This will take some time. Go take the dogs for a walk, or do your shopping.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When you return, open a browser on your PC, and in the url bar, enter:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>your-pi-local-ip-address:2286</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>...substituting "your-pi-local-ip-address" for the actual local IP address you noted earlier. Click on the Get Started button and create the admin user by entering an email address and password. It doesn't have to be your real email address, and to be honest, it's probably better if it isn't.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Well done. Immich is up and running, but there are a few more things to do before you can start using it as a Google Photos alternative.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="make-your-immich-server-accessible-from-anywhere">Make your Immich server accessible from anywhere</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You should already own a domain name. Visit your registrar, and locate the <strong>DNS</strong> or <strong>Advanced DNS </strong>section. Delete any records already set, and create a new one.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Set the host as @ and the value as your home IP address. Set the TTL value as low as you can.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This will ensure that requests to your domain name are forwarded to your home IP address. You'll also need to ensure your router knows what to do with the requests.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Your router admin page is usually accessible by typing 192.168.1.1 into the address bar. If not, check the side of the router which will give you the correct address along with the default admin password.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Log into your router and look for a section called port forwarding or port management. Create a new entry for ports 80 and 443 – setting the value to your Pi's local IP address. Enter your domain name, and you should see the default Apache placeholder page.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Back on the Pi, create a config file for Apache:</p>
<p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That's great, but you're not secured by TLS, meaning your traffic could be intercepted by a Person-in-the-middle attack. It's unlikely, but it's better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Run certbot with:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo certbot</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Answer the questions, then restart Apache again with:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo service apache2 restart</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That's it. You're done. Congratulations! Now install the apps on your phone.</p>

<p>AI chatbots are a wonder of the modern age and can assist with everything from coding to poetry. But accessing ChatGPT usually means signing up for an account. tgpt is a terminal interface that doesn't require an account or API key, and allows you to use ChatGPT 3.5 without leaving your terminal.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="why-use-tgpt" class="wp-block-heading">Why use tgpt?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When you sign up to use ChatGPT all of your queries, conversations, idle musings, and boundary-pushing questions are tied to your account.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Aside from the obvious privacy risks associated with using ChatGPT, a transcript of all your interactions could prove to be embarrassing - especially if you use the chatbot for writing difficult emails, cut your medical insurance premiums by using ChatGPT as a therapist, or<a href="https://linuximpact.com/tags/horoscope/"> use AI to prognosticate the future</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Using ChatGPT through the web interface is a far from ideal experience, and while there are already CLI tools that let you use ChatGPT from the Linux terminal, these require you to use an API key - a process that both complicates setting up the tool, and ensures that OpenAI can associate your queries with you - even if you use a VPN to hide your IP address.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By installiing tgpt, you get the convenience of using ChatGPT in your terminal, and you don't need to provide an API key or account details. You can use tgpt wherever you are, and even access it from behind a VPN.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The easiest way to install tgpt on Linux is with Go, so <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-install-go-on-linux/">make sure you have Go installed</a> before you begin.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now you can use Go to install tgpt:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>go install github.com/aandrew-me/tgpt@latest</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Go will install tgpt to <strong>~/go/bin/tgpt</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you want to easily use tgpt from any terminal location, you should create a symbolic link:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo ln -s ~/go/bin/tgpt /usr/bin/tgpt</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You can start tgpt by typing:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>tgpt</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>...wherever you are in the terminal.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this won't work on Windows, and is yet another addition to<a href="https://linuximpact.com/linux-vs-windows-which-is-best-for-your-pc/" data-type="link" data-id="https://linuximpact.com/linux-vs-windows-which-is-best-for-your-pc/"> why Linux is better than Windows</a>.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":277,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-277"><img  src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/31/tgpt-in-interactive-mode-1024x636.jpg" alt="tgpt in interactive mode showing a haiku about dogs and one about cats" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/31/responsive/tgpt-in-interactive-mode-1024x636-xs.webp 300w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/31/responsive/tgpt-in-interactive-mode-1024x636-sm.webp 480w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/31/responsive/tgpt-in-interactive-mode-1024x636-md.webp 768w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/31/responsive/tgpt-in-interactive-mode-1024x636-lg.webp 1024w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/31/responsive/tgpt-in-interactive-mode-1024x636-xl.webp 1360w ,https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/31/responsive/tgpt-in-interactive-mode-1024x636-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Using tgpt couldn't be easier. If you have a one of query or request for ChatGPT, and, for instance, want the chatbot to write a haiku about dogs, you'd enter:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>tgpt 'Write a haiku about dogs'</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Remember to surround your query with quote marks or tgpt will return a response for the first word only. Without quote marks in the above example, tgpt will respond as if you queried:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>tgpt write</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Not so useful.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>tgpt is most useful in interactive mode. To start tgpt in interactive mode, use the <strong>i</strong> flag:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>tgpt -i</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This allows you to conduct a complete conversation with ChatGPT, and its responses will be flavoured by your previous replies.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As with the web interface, your conversations can be long, meandering, and cover many topics.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You can can force tgpt to forget the chat ID with:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>tgpt -f</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Other useful flags include:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>-s Generate and Execute shell commands. (Experimental)<br>-c Generate Code. (Experimental)<br>-q Gives response back without loading animation<br>-w Gives response back as a whole text<br>-v Print version<br>-h Print help message<br>-m Start multi-line interactive mode<br>-u Update program</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Unlike with the ChatGPT web interface, you can use tgpt even when your hiding behind a VPN. This doesn't mean you can get away with naughty queries, though. Ask tgpt an inappropriate query and it'll respond that it's unable to assist you</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2 id="is-tgpt-too-good-to-be-true" class="wp-block-heading">Is tgpt too good to be true?</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In a word, yes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>tgpt is an awesome and fun way to access ChatGPT from your terminal, but it isn't truly a way to do it without API keys.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Instead of using your API key, tgpt uses the programme author's ChatGPT API key. Looking through the Github repository, you can see that the API key changes regularly. Presumably, this is because providing tgpt is a breach of ChatGPT terms of service.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If tgpt stops working for some reason, updating it with:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>tgpt -u</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>...should get it going again.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Having said that, it's unlikely that tgpt will continue working forever.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the meantime, enjoy it while it lasts.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Plasma is a gorgeous desktop environment from KDE, offering good looks, and a huge amount of functionality, and customisation.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Using Plasma is simple. It's easy to navigate, and comes with an intuitive application launcher menu with apps organised into categories, and extensive documentation. You can add frequently used programs to the taskbar, and you can quickly and easiliy manage some common settings from the system tray.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Plasma comes with a plethora of tools from KDE built in, including KRunner (an app to search, carry out functions, and run commands quickly), a hot-key activated drop-down terminal, and more Qt-derived goodness.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Arguably, the best thing about Plasma is the built-in customisations available. While all desktop environment support customisation, with Plasma, it's simple to make a fabulous looking desktop, which is completely unique, and which looks great.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Just about everything can be tailored to your needs with a couple of mouse clicks, and without needing to open the settings menu.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For more profound customisation, the "appearance" section of the settings menu allows you to change the entire theme, application styles, colours, window decorations, fonts, icons, cursors, splash screens, boot screens, and more.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Xfce one of the most widely used desktop environments, and has a well-deserved reputation for low resource use, while maintaining a premium look and feel.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With a stylised mouse as its logo, Xfce is instantly recognisable out of the box, but can be customised to look and behave however you want.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Unlike KDE Plasma, Xfce doesn't come with snazzy, resource hungry desktop animations, so is more suitable for use on lower-specced and older machines.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Xfce has a solid and deserved reputation as a stable and fast desktop environment, and ships with an array of useful default applications. These include the Thunar file manager, with which you can easily navigate your filesystem and carry out file operations; the Xfce4-terminal; and the ristretto image viewer.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Xfce doesn't have default apps for everything, and gives you the freedom to choose the best calendar, email client, photo library manager, music player, and more.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All of the included apps are blazingly fast to launch, and fast to use. If speed and efficiency in a good-looking DE are important to you, Xfce is the one to choose.</p>

<p>GNOME is the default desktop environment of several Linux distributions including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and RHEL. This is largely due to its lack of customisation options, meaning that it's more difficult to break. Its funding model, and backing by major non-profits means that it's unlikely to go away any time soon.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Consistency is key to the GNOME experience, and you're almost guaranteed a simplified and streamlined workflow, without having to worry about how it works, open the hood to fiddle with settings.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>GNOME is now in its third decade, and is continually innovating to be faster, more efficient, and better looking.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you're coming from Windows, you may find GNOME a bit of a shock. Linux is a different OS, and GNOME makes it feel like one.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The system menu opens full screen, but you'll find it easy to use after just a few sessions. GNOME system apps are sensible, and the DE comes with everything you need to maximise productivity.</p>

<p>LXDE is a super-lightweight desktop environment, with an absolute focus on low resource usage. Regardless what hardware you're using, LXDE can run basic operations as if it was brand new.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This doesn't mean that LXDE sacrifices good looks, and with care, your LXDE desktop can be quite beautiful.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As you'd expect, LXDE comes with a system tray, task bar, and menu, but with its emphasis on elegant simplicity there isn't much extra to distract you.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In our test, LXDE desktop on top of a standard Ubuntu install consumed only around 250MB of memory.</p>

<p>If you're coming from macOS, and want a familiar look and feel, the Pantheon desktop is for you. Designed for use with Elementary OS, you can install Pantheon desktop on any Linux system.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The first thing you'll notice about Pantheon is how well designed it is. The default desktop has minimal clutter, and commonly used apps are displayed in a neat, themeable macOS styled dock at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In keeping with its aesthetic, Pantheon comes with a curated selection of wallpapers, showing beautiful outdoor scenes of nature.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The app menu is distinctive and unusual in that apps aren't categorised by default. Instead, they're displayed alphabetically using large, colourful icons. You can either type to search, or press an additional button to bring up the full system menu.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Pantheon's default apps are consistently themed, with an elegant minimalism, which makes this desktop a joy to behold. You can install additional apps through the GUI Appcenter.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you're worried about cruft building up on your hard disk, Pantheon has you covered. The housekeeping app will automatically delete temporary files, trashed files, and old downloads after 30 days.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>While Pantheon is free and open source software, developers have implemented a "pay what you want" model. Don't worry though. You don't have to pay anything at all!</p>

<p>Deepin is a Chinese desktop environment designed to accompany Deepin Linux. Booting to desktop, you'll be instantly be reminded of Windows 10 - except better. Deepin desktop is slick, very stylised, and superbly consistent.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When you first start Deepin, you'll be asked to choose either "effect mode" to get the full benefit of Deepin's graphical glory, or "normal mode" if you have limited system resources. Both look great. You can also decide between the stylish "fashion mode", and the more staid "efficient mode".</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You'll also be prompted to set theming options including wallpapers and four different icon sets.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Launching apps is simple thanks to the traditional start menu, and if you're used to the GNOME way of doing things, you can expand this to a fullscreen launcher with categories on separate screens.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Built-in apps are developed in-house by Deepin, and are themed to be as unique and usable as the rest of the system.</p>
<p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There are hundreds of desktop environments available, and we've looked at six of the best. When choosing your desktop environment you should take into account what you need it to do. If you're using an old computer, you'll want a lightweight option such as LXDE or Xfce. If you want to tax your hardware in pursuit of premium visuals, then KDE Plasma or Deepin are great choices.</p>

<p>And then there is the spam - a small portion of it is blatant phishing or spear-phishing, but the majority is marketing from companies trying to sell a product and which bought a list of email addresses from another source.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A valid email address is a powerful tool and it is the foundation on which many cyber-attacks are built.</p>

<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In almost all cases, the basic authentication method for online services is an email address and a password. I can use my email address and password combo for Amazon, for Netflix, for ebay, for social media, and for countless others. Naturally, as a security conscious individual, I have different passwords for each of these, but many people do not.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This represents a huge security risk - as even if the password for an account is unknown, even the knowledge that an account exists is of interest to hackers, as it can be used as a vector for convincing phishing attacks.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you need an email address for a one-time sign up, and you’re sure you will never need to use the address again, there are so-called public email addresses. These sites will give you access to a shared email address without a password, which can be accessed by anyone with a link.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The services can be used to receive one-time activation codes, or to gain access to a site which requires you to have an account.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The upside is that you don’t need to give out your genuine email address - bypassing email verification processes, but that downside is that anyone can see the emails you receive. The address may also receive email destined for other people, and you will not be able to send emails from this address.</p>

<p>How did your email get onto a list of spam senders? In all likelihood, it was leaked, sold, or hacked - and if you use this tip it’s easy to find out where from.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Thanks to a convention which began in the early 2000s, most email providers allow users an easy way of creating aliases for incoming mail by ignoring the plus symbol (+) and everything after it in an incoming mail.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As an example, if your email address was johnsmith@example.com, it would be able to receive mail addressed to johnsmith+123456789@example.com.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You can use this trick to add details of who you gave your email address to, so when it is inevitably used to send you spam, you know who to blame.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For instance, if you use your johnsmith@example.com email address to sign up for a Walmart gift card, you could give your address as johnsmith+asdagiftcard@example.com. Emails from Asda would still arrive, and you would be able to tell if Asda had lost or sold your data.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This can have financial implications. Europe’s GDPR rules mean that if a company breaches data protection laws, you can <a href="https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/data-protection-and-journalism/taking-your-case-to-court-and-claiming-compensation/">take them to court and claim compensation</a>. In the US, data theft and data misuse are routinely followed by lawsuits.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="option-3-buy-a-domain-with-catch-all-forwarding">3: Use a domain with catch-all forwarding</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The downside to dynamic aliasing using the plus symbol is that it’s easy for scammers to defeat. It’s trivial to create a script which will strip everything after the ‘+’ and up to the ‘@’ in order to reveal your true email address - the one you probably use for your most important online transactions.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But it’s possible for you to create unlimited email addresses at minimal cost if you buy your own domain name.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You can purchase a domain name from namecheap for $1.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To set up catch-all email forwarding from namecheap.com. Search for the domain name you want using the site’s search bar. and select a top level domain from the options presented. .com domains tend to be the most popular and can be expensive. Less well known top level domains, such as .xyz, .click, or .cyou can be much cheaper.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once the purchase is complete, click on ‘Manage’, scroll down to the ‘Redirect Email’ section, and click ‘Add Catch-All’. In the ‘ Forward To’ field, add your own email address.</p>
<p>

<p>What this means is that you can now give out any address so long as you own the domain name, and emails sent to it will end up in you main email account inbox.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You can use amazon@your-domain.com for Amazon purchases, bp@your-domain.com for your petrol station loyalty card, and lidl@your-domain.com for lidl plus. It does not reveal your primary email address, and in the event your details are leaked, it’s easy to track down the culprit.</p>

<p>Catch-all email aliasing is cheap, and super-easy to set up, but you can’t use it as a fully functional email address because it doesn’t allow you to send mail - only receive it.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Fortunately, there are services which allow you to deploy and manage email aliases easily, and from which you can send, as well as receive mail.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One such provider is <a href="https://anonaddy.com/">AnonAddy</a>. AnonAddy offers free and paid subscriptions (up to $4 per month). I signed up to the free plan which offers, unlimited standard aliases, two recipients and a meagre 10MB bandwidth.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The free plan allows you to pick a username which will be used as a subdomain. This means that if you pick the username davidisthecoolest<em>,</em> all of your email aliases will be at davidisthecoolest.anonaddy.com.</p>

<p>During account creation you will be asked for your real email address and to accept the privacy policy (I’ve read it and so should you).</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Usage is simple, and to aliases are created as they are used. This means that if I were to give the address asda@LinuxImpact.anonaddy.com to my local Asda, the email address would pop into existence as soon as the first email is sent to it.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You can also create an alias by clicking ‘Create new alias’. It is not possible to specify the alias this way if you are on the free plan.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By default, emails are forwarded to the main email address you specified during the signup process, but from the alias dashboard, you will be able to specify which aliases should be forwarded to which named recipient.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you find that an alias is receiving a lot of spam, you can easily deactivate the alias by clicking on the toggle switch. Any emails sent to the alias when it has been deactivated, will show as ‘blocked’ on the dashboard.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Using your alias to reply to emails is simple. Just hit reply in the main email account. The reply will be sent to AnonAddy, which will then forward the email to the intended recipient, and it will appear as if it is coming from the alias.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Sending an email is a little more complicated and requires special formatting.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If I want to send an email to david@example.com using my private@LinuxImpact.anonaddy.com address, I would need to put the following into the ‘to’ field.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>private+david=example.com@LinuxImpact.anonaddy.com</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Subscribing to either the Lite or the Pro plan allows you to use your own custom domain names rather than anonaddy subdomains.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>AnonAddy is a great service, but to use it to its full potential you need to pay, and to use it at all, you need to consent to your activity being logged and potentially shared with law enforcement.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The software itself is open source - meaning that you can modify it, contribute to the main project or deploy it yourself, whether on your on hardware at home (A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&tag=thecrowuk-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=869671b3a6c888e9aa60686f08e69c37&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=pc-hardware&keywords=Raspberry Pi" data-type="page" data-id="327" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raspberry Pi </a>is ideal for this) or on a VPS - which can be rented for as little as $10 per year.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Setup is fairly straightforward, although time consuming, and grants you unrestricted usage - allowing you to create and manage as many email aliases as you like.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="option-6-bitwarden">6: BitWarden</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden</a> is an all-singing, all dancing FOSS password manager and comes in both hosted and self-hosted flavours.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In a nutshell, BitWarden helps you to generate and manage passwords for different sites. One recently-added feature is the ability to create and manage email aliases on the fly to log into different sites. Combined this with a catch-all mailbox and you’re golden.</p>
