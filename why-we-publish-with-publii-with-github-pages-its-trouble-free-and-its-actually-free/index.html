semi-permanent hiatus, and from which several of the articles on Linux Imact were culled - was created as a static site using Jekyll.

WordPress is great software, and there's a reason it powers more than half of the websites online today.</p><p>It was...fine. It's easy to get a website looking <em>OK</em> quickly, and there's no messing around with text editors.</p><p>And everything worked well until we start getting decent amounts of traffic. After appearing on the HN front page, we were quickly forced offline - struggling under numbers that a static site would have handled with ease.</p><p>Yes, we could have eased the burden by using a CDN to deliver images and other content from elsewhere on the web, and we did seriously consider doing exactly that.</p><p>But once we arrived at the realisation that it wasn't entirely practical to completely host this website on a bargain basement SBC and a domestic internet connection, we started to wonder why we were hosting it at home in the first place.</p><h2 id="h-making-better-design-decisions">Making better design decisions</h2><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/designer.jpg" alt="" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/designer-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/designer-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/designer-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/designer-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/designer-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/designer-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>The first decision we made was that <em>all</em><strong><em> </em></strong>content was going to be hosted offsite. <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Pages</a> was the natural choice, as hosting is both free and fast - although there's an ever present nagging feeling that current owner, Microsoft, will, at some point, pull the rug and spiral into service enshitification.</p><p>You can host any content you like on Github Pages. You can use your own domain name, and they'll even throw in SSL certs for free. It's pretty easy to set up, with the only proviso being that the content needs to be static. If you're hosting a web shop, or anything that requires users to sign in, static sites probably aren't for you anyway.</p><p>While WordPress is excellent as a content management system, and it's possible to create a site using WorPress and export it as static pages, it's a bit fiddly for our tastes, and we've always found messing around with themes, layouts and widgets to be an annoyance rather than a feature.</p><p>Jekyll was an option. Writing Markdown and creating sites with Jekyll is fun, but now that Atom, our favourite text editor has been archived, it's not as much fun as it used to be.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/publii-marketplace.jpg" alt="The Publii marketplace showing a selection of themes" width="1680" height="840" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-marketplace-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-marketplace-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-marketplace-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-marketplace-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-marketplace-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/42/responsive/publii-marketplace-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>Publii is a static site generator with all the bells and whistles you can imagine, and a for producing and editing posts, it's not all that different from the back-end of a WordPress blog: convenience, a variety of editors, a marketplace for themes and plugins. While our WordPress instance was periodically dropping offline and heroically resurfacing, we were able to port our meagre content into Publii, and get set up for free on GitHub.</p><p>Sure, GitHub pages has usage limits, but they're quite generous:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>GitHub Pages source repositories have a recommended limit of 1 GB.

These rate limits are not intended to interfere with legitimate uses of GitHub Pages. If your request triggers rate limiting, you will receive an appropriate response with an HTTP status code of <code>429</code>, along with an informative HTML body.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>We very much doubt we're going to hit those limits.</p><h2 id="h-creating-static-sites-is-simple-with-publii">Creating static sites is simple with Publii</h2><p>Publii is Free software licensed under GPL3.

You can also choose an adorable little icon to represent yourself and the site within Publii. We went with a steaming hot cup of coffee. Hit the big blue button and get started.</p><p>This is where our experience most likely differed from most Publii users, because we weren't creating a website from scratch - we already had our struggling WordPress instance.</p><p>Following the very well-written and understandable Publii instructions, we logged into WordPress, and from the admin panel clicked <strong>tools &gt; export</strong> to download an XML file containing posts, authors, category, and tag content. The file itself is only a few hundred kilobytes, so took only moments.</p><p>Adding our exported content to Publii took longer. The process itself is simple, just click <strong>Tools &amp; Plugins &gt; WP Importer</strong>, then select the file you just downloaded.

Handy hint: Don't use relative URLS or you won't get an RSS feed. Once that's done, hit <strong>Sync your Website</strong> to create the static files.
