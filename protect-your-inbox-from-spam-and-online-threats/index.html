In all likelihood, it was leaked, sold, or hacked - and if you use this tip it’s easy to find out where from.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Thanks to a convention which began in the early 2000s, most email providers allow users an easy way of creating aliases for incoming mail by ignoring the plus symbol (+) and everything after it in an incoming mail.</p><p></p><p></p><p>As an example, if your email address was johnsmith@example.com, it would be able to receive mail addressed to johnsmith+123456789@example.com.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can use this trick to add details of who you gave your email address to, so when it is inevitably used to send you spam, you know who to blame.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For instance, if you use your johnsmith@example.com email address to sign up for a Walmart gift card, you could give your address as johnsmith+asdagiftcard@example.com. Emails from Asda would still arrive, and you would be able to tell if Asda had lost or sold your data.</p><p></p><p></p><p>This can have financial implications. Europe’s GDPR rules mean that if a company breaches data protection laws, you can <a href="https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/data-protection-and-journalism/taking-your-case-to-court-and-claiming-compensation/">take them to court and claim compensation</a>. In the US, data theft and data misuse are routinely followed by lawsuits.</p><p></p><p></p><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="option-3-buy-a-domain-with-catch-all-forwarding">3: Use a domain with catch-all forwarding</h3><p></p><p></p><p>The downside to dynamic aliasing using the plus symbol is that it’s easy for scammers to defeat. It’s trivial to create a script which will strip everything after the ‘+’ and up to the ‘@’ in order to reveal your true email address - the one you probably use for your most important online transactions.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But it’s possible for you to create unlimited email addresses at minimal cost if you buy your own domain name.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can purchase a domain name from namecheap for $1.</p><p></p><p></p><p>To set up catch-all email forwarding from namecheap.com. Search for the domain name you want using the site’s search bar. and select a top level domain from the options presented. .com domains tend to be the most popular and can be expensive. Less well known top level domains, such as .xyz, .click, or .cyou can be much cheaper.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Once the purchase is complete, click on ‘Manage’, scroll down to the ‘Redirect Email’ section, and click ‘Add Catch-All’. In the ‘ Forward To’ field, add your own email address.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-324"><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/33/set_up_namecheap_catchall_address-1024x210.jpg" alt="Set up email forwarding with namecheap" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/33/responsive/set_up_namecheap_catchall_address-1024x210-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/33/responsive/set_up_namecheap_catchall_address-1024x210-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/33/responsive/set_up_namecheap_catchall_address-1024x210-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/33/responsive/set_up_namecheap_catchall_address-1024x210-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/33/responsive/set_up_namecheap_catchall_address-1024x210-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/33/responsive/set_up_namecheap_catchall_address-1024x210-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p>What this means is that you can now give out any address so long as you own the domain name, and emails sent to it will end up in you main email account inbox.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You can use amazon@your-domain.com for Amazon purchases, bp@your-domain.com for your petrol station loyalty card, and lidl@your-domain.com for lidl plus.
