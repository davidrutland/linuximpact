If you’re using Google - or any cloud provider, you can’t assume that anything is private at all. The cloud is just someone else’s computer and if you’re not paying for it, you’re the product - you’ve heard it all before and I’m sure you’re as tired of the old truisms as I am.</p><p>But they’re truisms for a reason, and it’s accepted as fact that Big G mines everything for clues as to your sexual orientation, pet ownership status, and how often you brush your teeth. They do this so they can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/all-the-data-facebook-google-has-on-you-privacy">aim advertising at you and sell the data to other companies to sell you advertising</a>.</p><p>But there’s an expectation of privacy, regardless. Especially if you’re using it for work-related purposes. I know it doesn’t make sense, but literally billions of people use Google services. They email their friends, relations, and co-workers using Gmail or GSuite; They write novels, formulate plans; share works-in-progress and conduct business using Google’s (frankly excellent) online office suite.</p><p>Because it works so very very well, it’s easy to ignore that all Google products exist for the sole purpose of mining information.</p><p>Until they remind you.</p><h2 id="content-scanning-is-business-as-usual">Content scanning is business as usual</h2><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/53/google_is_watching.jpg" alt="A pair of scary red eyes" width="1436" height="322" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/53/responsive/google_is_watching-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/53/responsive/google_is_watching-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/53/responsive/google_is_watching-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/53/responsive/google_is_watching-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/53/responsive/google_is_watching-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/53/responsive/google_is_watching-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>One of this author's part time freelance gigs is writing for a VPN affiliate company masquerading as a privacy website.

Which is weird, because I wrote the text for the supposedly phony email myself. To the best of my knowledge, it doesn’t actually exist in the wild, it’s new.</p><p>It doesn’t take a huge leap of imagination to realise this means that Google must be doing some kind of AI analysis and the AI grabbed the wrong end of the stick. It’s pretty freaking scary.</p><p>Again, there’s an assumption from users that what they write is, apart from data mining for ads and tracking, to a certain extent, private.</p><p>Writing about phishing emails isn’t illegal, sending phishing emails isn’t in itself illegal - although it doesn’t take much for it to become illegal in most places.</p><p>Google is blocking me from sharing my perfectly legal content. Worse, it was actually looking through my perfectly legal content - for purposes other than spamming me with crappy ads (which I block with <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">PiHole</a> and <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a>) and renting out my data to shady companies.</p><p>It was a side effect of Google scanning every single document on every single Google account for content that Google deemed dangerous or contrary to the public good.</p><p>There is a huge difference between scanning content for advertising and scanning content for… well… content.</p><h2 id="the-rules-can-change-arbitrarily">The rules can change arbitrarily</h2><p>OK. So if I <em>had</em> been preparing a phishing email to send out, that would have been pretty dodgy. Phishing undermines confidence in Google’s services and harms their ad revenue - especially since Gmail’s spam filters are notoriously awful.</p><p>So it’s reasonable, from a business point of view, for them to prevent me using their software to create phishing emails (which, again, I was not doing).</p><p>But Google has been invading people’s privacy in the name of public interest for a while now. Who can forget that the company <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/google-drive-takes-down-user-file-plandemic/">removed users’ access to their personal copy of Judy Mikovits’ ‘Plandemic’</a> which was stored in their personal drives.</p><p>Yes, it’s a shitty video which probably was the indirect cause of thousands of deaths, but it belonged to the users whose drive it was in. There was no warning.</p><p>It’s a well known fact that Google will also pass on private documents and emails to law enforcement agencies who ask nicely, and sometimes, they will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/aug/17/google-giving-user-data-authorities-documents-reveal">proactively report users to authorities</a> - even if they don’t ban the user.</p><p>Again, these tend to be shitty people, but not cool, Google.</p><h2 id="dont-store-anything-even-remotely-sensitive-on-google-servers">Don’t store anything even remotely sensitive on Google servers.</h2><p>Back in the late 90’s The Crow used to have a copy of Jolly Roger’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3bvSrga">Cookbook</a> on floppy disk. I used it as a handy reference and used to joyfully blow stuff up in my back garden. That particular reference work is illegal to possess in the UK under <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/58">Section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000</a>. It’s counted as ‘information likely to be useful to a terrorist.’</p><p>I don’t have a copy now, and the Cookbook link above won’t take you through to the free electronic version, because anyone in the UK following that link would be committing an offence under the same act. You’d be arrested, and I’d feel bad about it.</p><p>In the event I wanted to store a personal copy on Google Drive, there’s a pretty good chance that Big G would rat me out to the local fuzz.</p><p>Google operates worldwide, and things which are completely lawful in one place, are often illegal elsewhere. Consider what Google may be willing to tell authorities in China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Italy, or indeed, the UK.</p><p>I wouldn’t even think about organising or planning demonstrations or protests using <em>any</em> Google services.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/53/armed_riot_police_at_a_protest.jpg" alt="armed police at a riot.

It can be deployed in minutes and allows anonymous collaborative creation and editing of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and polls – all running on your own Pi based server in your own house. All documents are encrypted, and cannot be accessed or read by anyone without authorisation.</p><p>I ditched it as soon as I was able, because using any of its features will result in incessant nagging for users to create accounts - so anonymous sharing was a painful experience. These intrusions can be turned off through configuring some server settings with a text editor, but if you <em>do</em> intend to limit access using accounts, the credentials are stored on and authenticated by Cryptpad servers, rather than your own. You don’t have full control, and if the Cryptpad servers go offline for any reason, you’ve lost access to everything.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/53/cryptpad_on_raspberry_pi.jpg" alt="A blank document open in the Cryptpad editoe" width="1272" height="697" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/53/responsive/cryptpad_on_raspberry_pi-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/53/responsive/cryptpad_on_raspberry_pi-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/53/responsive/cryptpad_on_raspberry_pi-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/53/responsive/cryptpad_on_raspberry_pi-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/53/responsive/cryptpad_on_raspberry_pi-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/53/responsive/cryptpad_on_raspberry_pi-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><h3 id="etherpad">Etherpad</h3><p><a href="https://etherpad.org/#download">Etherpad</a> is the bedrock on which Google docs was built, and in their magnanimity Google has left the software open source under an Apache License.
