were a kid in the early 1990s, you'll remember the gaming revolution that was the Nintendo Game Boy. Sure, there were portable gaming systems before - the Game &amp; Watch in particular springs to mind - but these were single game units. You could play Donkey Kong or Chef, or if you were really swish, the double screened Super Mario Bros.</p><p></p><p></p><p>But you could play thousands of titles on a Game Boy - thanks to its cartridge system that meant you were, in essence, carrying a console in your pocket.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Later Game Boy models and other manufacturers brought handheld gaming into the mainstream, and it was rare to see a classroom without a few suspiciously bulging pockets stuffed with GBAs, PSPs, and who can can forget the Sega Game Gear?

The Leapster GS entered the world in 2012, and for a handheld kids' toy had fairly decent specs. Internal storage was measured in the low gigabytes, and its 500 MHz processor meant that it was, in theory, more powerful than Sony's still-in-production Playstation 2. The screen, though small, was a usable touchscreen and stylus, with good colour even in broad daylight. It had buttons and a D-pad designed for gaming. There was even a camera!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Like the Game Boy series, Leapster GS games came on a cartridge. Unlike Nintendo's offerings, the games were Flash-based, and exclusively angled towards educating children between the ages of four and nine. Remember Flash? It powered most of the games on the internet for a while, and is now lost to the sands of history.</p><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-358"><img loading="lazy" src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/37/leapster-gs-page-1024x505.jpg" alt="official Leapfrog sales page for the Leapster GS showing the official MRSP of $9.99" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/37/responsive/leapster-gs-page-1024x505-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/37/responsive/leapster-gs-page-1024x505-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/37/responsive/leapster-gs-page-1024x505-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/37/responsive/leapster-gs-page-1024x505-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/37/responsive/leapster-gs-page-1024x505-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/37/responsive/leapster-gs-page-1024x505-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p>If you want to buy a spanky new Leapster GS, the Leapfrog website still has them listed for the bargain price of $49.99. Games are limited, pricey, and seldom available from the official source - although you can find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LeapFrog-McStuffins-Learning-Platinum-LeapsterGS/dp/B00D38UBJ6?&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=thecrowuk-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=821c1687ea0c67b6aff2db2e2e67bed9&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Disney Doc McStuffins Learning Game</a> on Amazon for $25.99.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A quick eBay search shows a moderately active Leapster GS market place, with "spares and repairs" items with a Buy It Now price of £5, while at the upper end, a Leapster GS with a carry case and one original game is currently tagged at £45, and it doesn't even have battery packs.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The advice we'd give is that if you can find a decent one for under £20, bag it - and give it a new lease of life as an emulation station you can fit in your pocket.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 id="h-grab-a-used-bargain" class="wp-block-heading">Grab a used bargain</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Given that the Leapster is essentially useless to kids over the age of seven, it's not surprising that they end up being shoved to the back of a drawer until the child eventually leaves home for college, and parents have the unenviable task of sorting through two decades of discarded shit, and deciding what's actually worth keeping.</p><p></p><p></p><p>If they've been well looked after, artefacts such as the Leapster GS tend to end up in charity shops (The British version of a Thrift store, or possibly GoodWill).</p><p></p><p></p><p>We were lucky enough to find an almost perfect example for a fiver in a British Heart Foundation shop near to the Linux Impact mansion. A fiver! OK, so the buttons had lost some of their paint, and it was a bit grimy, but otherwise it was in perfect nick. Even better, the four AA battery slots were filled with rechargeable cells, and it came with a charger. The lack of game cartridges to accompany the unit probably contributed to the price and failed to deter us one iota.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 id="h-we-use-arch-btw" class="wp-block-heading">We use (Retro)Arch BTW</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Unlike certain other consoles manufacturers that go to great lengths to ensure lock-in, and that you can't use your Steam library on a PS5, Leapfrog has no such protections in place, meaning that enterprising individuals have taken the time to develop alternate firmware for the device.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Retroleap works on the LeapsterGS and LeapPad2, and combines Retroarch, ARM-optimized emulator cores, and a buildroot root filesystem.</p><p></p><p></p><p>With Retroleap, converting the Leapfrog Leapster GS from a poorly conceived semi-educational toy to a kickass portable games console didn't take long. The biggest hurdle was finding a compatible cable.</p><p></p><p></p><p>By the time our pocket pal appeared on the scene, Micro-USB had been the industry standard for five years, so it's kind of baffling that Leapfrog went with the older Mini USB interface. You won't find one in your local supermarket or Poundland, and they were becoming a rarity even in 2012. Fortunately, we never throw a cable away, and after an afternoon sifting through three large bin bags of electronic paraphernalia, were able to locate one that had previously been used with a digital camera.</p><p></p><p></p><p>After that, it was a case of following the instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/mac2612/retroleap">Retroleap GitHub repo</a>:</p><p></p><p></p><p>Making sure we had the necessary dependencies:</p><p></p><p></p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>sudo apt install sg3-utils git python</code></pre><p></p><p></p><p>Cloning sshflash:</p><p></p><p></p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>git clone https://github.com/mac2612/sshflash.git &amp;&amp; cd sshflash</code></pre><p></p><p></p><p>Downloading and unzipping the latest release into the sshflash directory:</p><p></p><p></p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>wget <a href="https://github.com/mac2612/retroleap/releases/download/v2.0.0-alpha10/retroleap_v2.0.0-alpha10.zip">https://github.com/mac2612/retroleap/releases/download/v2.0.0-alpha10/retroleap_v2.0.0-alpha10.zip</a><br><br>unzip retroleap_v2.0.0-alpha10.zip<br><br>rm retroleap_v2.0.0-alpha10.zip</code></pre><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-359"><img loading="lazy" src="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/37/turning-on-the-leapster-1024x469.jpg" alt="A grimy leapster GS with fingers positioned in an awkward way" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/37/responsive/turning-on-the-leapster-1024x469-xs.webp 300w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/37/responsive/turning-on-the-leapster-1024x469-sm.webp 480w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/37/responsive/turning-on-the-leapster-1024x469-md.webp 768w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/37/responsive/turning-on-the-leapster-1024x469-lg.webp 1024w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/37/responsive/turning-on-the-leapster-1024x469-xl.webp 1360w, https://linuximpact.com/media/posts/37/responsive/turning-on-the-leapster-1024x469-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Did we mention our unit was dirty?
